	abstract = {© 2016 American Physical Society. Wave diffraction is fundamentally difficult to overcome in the routing and interconnection of photonic signals. Although the phenomenon of reflectionless transport through sharp corners in a routing path has been realized in many previous demonstrations, wave diffraction does not allow them to transport deep-subwavelength information or sub-diffraction-limited images. Recent advances in E-near-zero and anisotropic E-near-infinity metamaterials have provided unique possibilities of achieving reflectionless diffraction-free electromagnetic wave routing, but their designs are fundamentally limited to narrow bandwidths, and they have not been demonstrated in reality. Here we experimentally demonstrate broadband reflectionless diffraction-free routing of electromagnetic waves through two right-angled sharp corners in a bent microwave rectangular waveguide. An image with deep-subwavelength information is transported through the bent waveguide in a broad bandwidth. This Rapid Communication supplements and extends the current studies of metamaterials with extreme permittivities and can be useful for routing and interconnection of subwavelength photonic information.},

            Free‐electron radiation is a fundamental photon emission process that is induced by fast‐moving electrons interacting with optical media. Historically, it has been understood that, just like any other photon emission process, free‐electron radiation must be constrained within a finite time interval known as the “formation time,” whose concept is applicable to both Cherenkov radiation and transition radiation, the two basic mechanisms describing radiation from a bulk medium and from an interface, respectively. Here, this work reveals an alternative mechanism of free‐electron radiation far beyond the previously defined formation time. It occurs when a fast electron crosses the interface between vacuum and a plasmonic medium supporting bulk plasmons. While emitted continuously from the crossing point on the interface—thus consistent with the features of transition radiation—the extra radiation beyond the conventional formation time is supported by a long tail of bulk plasmons following the electron's trajectory deep into the plasmonic medium. Such a plasmonic tail mixes surface and bulk effects, and provides a sustained channel for electron–interface interaction. These results also settle the historical debate in Ferrell radiation, regarding whether it is a surface or bulk effect, from transition radiation or plasmonic oscillation.},
