	abstract = {Photons have been a ﬂagship system for studying quantum mechanics, advancing quantum information science, and developing quantum technologies. Quantum entanglement, teleportation, quantum key distribution, and early quantum computing demonstrations were pioneered in this technology because photons represent a naturally mobile and low-noise system with quantum-limited detection readily available. The quantum states of individual photons can be manipulated with very high precision using interferometry, an experimental staple that has been under continuous development since the 19th century. The complexity of photonic quantum computing devices and protocol realizations has raced ahead as both underlying technologies and theoretical schemes have continued to develop. Today, photonic quantum computing represents an exciting path to medium- and large-scale processing. It promises to put aside its reputation for requiring excessive resource overheads due to inefﬁcient two-qubit gates. Instead, the ability to generate large numbers of photons—and the development of integrated platforms, improved sources and detectors, novel noise-tolerant theoretical approaches, and more—have solidiﬁed it as a leading contender for both quantum information processing and quantum networking. Our concise review provides a ﬂyover of some key aspects of the ﬁeld, with a focus on experiment. Apart from being a short and accessible introduction, its many references to in-depth articles and longer specialist reviews serve as a launching point for deeper study of the ﬁeld.},

Optical near fields are created by excitation of a thin, nanometer-sized Yagi-Uda antenna, with 20 fs near-infrared laser pulses. Phase matching between electrons and near fields is achieved due to strong spatial confinement of the antenna near field. Energyresolved projection images of the antenna are recorded in an optical pump−electron probe scheme. We show that the phase modulation of the electron by transverse-field components results in a transient electron deflection while longitudinal near-field components broaden the kinetic energy distribution.

	abstract = {The short de Broglie wavelength and strong interaction empower free electrons to probe scattering and excitations in materials and resolve the structure of biomolecules. Recent advances in using nanophotonic structures to mediate bilinear electron-photon interaction have brought novel optical manipulation schemes to electron beams, enabling high space-time-energy resolution electron microscopy, quantum-coherent optical modulation, attosecond metrology and pulse generation, transverse electron wavefront shaping, dielectric laser acceleration, and electron-photon pair generation. However, photonic nanostructures also exhibit nonlinearities, which have to date not been exploited for electron-photon interactions. Here, we report the interaction of electrons with spontaneously generated Kerr nonlinear optical states inside a continuous-wave driven photonic chip-based microresonator. Optical parametric processes give rise to spatiotemporal pattern formation, or dissipative structures, corresponding to coherent or incoherent optical frequency combs. By coupling such microcombs in situ to electron beams, we demonstrate that different dissipative structures induce distinct fingerprints in the electron spectra and Ramsey-type interference patterns. In particular, using spontaneously formed femtosecond temporal solitons, we achieve ultrafast temporal gating of the electron beam without the necessity of a pulsed laser source or a pulsed electron source. Our work elucidates the interaction of free electrons with a variety of nonlinear dissipative states, demonstrates the ability to access solitons inside an electron microscope, and extends the use of microcombs to unexplored territories, with ramifications in novel ultrafast electron microscopy, light-matter interactions driven by on-chip temporal solitons, and ultra-high spatiotemporal resolution sampling of nonlinear optical dynamics and devices.},

Although the interaction of electron beams with photonic modes is generally weak, the use of optical pumping produces stimulated electron−light interactions that can exceed orderunity probabilities in photon-induded near ﬁeld electron microscopy (PINEM). Here, we demonstrate that PINEM can locally and quantitatively probe the nonlinear optical response. Speciﬁcally, we predict a dependence of PINEM electron spectra on the sample nonlinearity that can reveal the second-harmonic (SH) response of optical materials with nanometer resolution, observed through asymmetries between electron energy losses and gains. We illustrate this concept by showing that PINEM spectra are sensitive to the SH near ﬁeld of centrosymmetric structures and by ﬁnding substantial spectral asymmetries in geometries for which the linear interaction is reduced.},

Chip-based photonics 19,20 promises unique applications in nanoscale quantum control and sensing but remains to be realized in electron microscopy. Here we merge integrated photonics with electron microscopy, demonstrating coherent phase modulation of a continuous electron beam using a silicon nitride microresonator. The high-finesse ( Q 0 ≈ 10 6 ) cavity enhancement and a waveguide designed for phase matching lead to efficient electron–light scattering at extremely low, continuous-wave optical powers. Specifically, we fully deplete the initial electron state at a cavity-coupled power of only 5.35 microwatts and generate {\textbackslash}textgreater500 electron energy sidebands for several milliwatts. Moreover, we probe unidirectional intracavity fields with microelectronvolt resolution in electron-energy-gain spectroscopy 21 . The fibre-coupled photonic structures feature single-optical-mode electron–light interaction with full control over the input and output light. This approach establishes a versatile and highly efficient framework for enhanced electron beam control in the context of laser phase plates 22 , beam modulators and continuous-wave attosecond pulse trains 23 , resonantly enhanced spectroscopy 24–26 and dielectric laser acceleration 19,20,27 .

However, due to the fundamental tradeoff between gate fidelity and execution time, as well as limited scalability, the use of cavity-QED for quantum computation was overtaken by other architectures. Here, we introduce a new element into cavity-QED – a free charged particle, acting as a flying qubit. Using free electrons as a specific example, we demonstrate that our approach enables ultrafast, deterministic and universal discrete-variable quantum computation in a cavity-QED-based architecture, with potentially improved scalability. Our proposal hinges on a novel excitation blockade mechanism in a resonant interaction between a free-electron and a cavity polariton. This nonlinear interaction is faster by several orders of magnitude with respect to current photon-based cavity-QED gates, enjoys wide tunability and can demonstrate fidelities close to unity. Furthermore, our scheme is ubiquitous to any cavity nonlinearity, either due to light-matter coupling as in the Jaynes-Cummings model or due to photon-photon interactions as in a Kerr-type many-body system. In addition to promising advancements in cavity-QED quantum computation, our approach paves the way towards ultrafast and deterministic generation of highly-entangled photonic graph states and is applicable to other quantum technologies involving cavity-QED.},

In this context, attosecond electron compression has been recently demonstrated through interaction with the near fields created by scattering of ultrashort laser pulses at nanostructures followed by free-electron propagation. Here, we show that control over electron pulse shaping, compression, and statistics can be improved by replacing coherent laser excitation by interaction with quantum light. We find that compression is accelerated for fixed optical intensity by using phase-squeezed light, while amplitude squeezing produces ultrashort double-pulse profiles. The generated electron pulses exhibit periodic revivals in complete analogy to the optical Talbot effect. We further reveal that the coherences created in a sample by interaction with the modulated electron are strongly dependent on the statistics of the modulating light, while the diagonal part of the sample density matrix reduces to a Poissonian distribution regardless of the type of light used to shape the electron. The present study opens a new direction toward the generation of free-electron pulses with additional control over duration, shape, and statistics, which directly affect their interaction with a sample.},

	abstract = {We present the quantum theory governing the interaction between short laser pulses and relativistic free electrons and reveal intrinsic conservation laws for such quantum interactions. Through the judicious design of the amplitude and phase of a laser pulse, we propose the complete shaping of the electron temporal wavepacket and energy spectrum. To exemplify the prospects and limitations of the shaping process, we optimize laser pulses that can reduce the energy spread of an electron beam. We also ﬁnd attosecond laser pulse trains that generate electron combs with record short attosecond features that push the lowest limits of electron temporal duration. We propose to utilize the quantum shaping of the electron energy spectrum for a new kind of light−matter interaction: Matching the shaped electron energy shift to a target material excitation. This way we can transfer the electron coherent state into a new coherent material excitation, allowing access to states that are forbidden with optical excitations. Our formalism generalizes all the previous theoretical models in the area of photon-induced nearﬁeld electron microscopy (PINEM); our formalism can ﬁt experiments in the ﬁeld that cannot be modeled by the conventional PINEM theory. Altogether, our new formalism of shaping quantum electron-laser interactions in the dimension of time/energy has prospects for novel phenomena in attosecond science, for new techniques in electron microscopy, and for their potential marriage in ultrafast quantum electron optics.},

	abstract = {The past decade has witnessed a quantum revolution in the ﬁeld of computation, communication and materials investigation. A similar revolution is also occurring for free-electron based techniques, where the classical treatment of a free electron as a point particle is being surpassed toward a deeper exploitation of its quantum nature. Adopting familiar concepts from quantum optics, several groups have demonstrated temporal and spatial shaping of a free-electron wave function, developing theoretical descriptions of light-modulated states, as well as predicting and conﬁrming fascinating phenomena as attosecond self-compression and orbital angular momentum transfer from light to electrons. In this review, we revisit the milestones of this development and the several methods adopted for imprinting a time-varying phase modulation on an electron wave function using properly synthesized ultrafast light ﬁelds, making the electron an exquisitely selective probe of out-of-equilibrium phenomena in individual atomic/nanoscale systems. We discuss both longitudinal and transverse phase manipulation of free-electrons, where coherent quantized exchanges of energy, linear momentum and orbital angular momentum mediating the electron–light coupling are key in determining their spatio-temporal redistribution. Spatio-temporal phase shaping of matter waves provides new routes toward image-resolution enhancement, selective probing, dynamic control of materials, new quantum information methods, and exploration of electronic motions and nuclear phenomena. Emerging as a new ﬁeld, electron wave function shaping allows adopting familiar quantum optics concepts in compositeparticle experiments and paves the way for atomic, ionic and nuclear wave function engineering with perspective applications in atomic interferometry and direct control of nuclear processes.},

The π/2-pulse and π-pulse in synthetic Rabi dynamics can function as 'beam splitters' and 'mirrors' for free-electron interferometry, allowing us to detect local electromagnetic fields and plasmonic excitations. When the coupling field is quantized, we can observe quantum and vacuum Rabi oscillations of the two-level electron, which can be used to investigate the quantum statistics of optical excitations and electron-photon entanglement. Recent advances in laser control of electron microscopes and spectroscopes makes the experimental detection of synthetic Rabi oscillations possible. However, observing the quantum Rabi oscillation of electrons remains challenging. Our work has the potential to advance various fundamentals and applications of resonant light-matter interactions between low-energy electrons and quatum light.},

In particular, they are promising candidates for monochromatic, table‐top X‐ray sources. This work reveals that the versatility of the table‐top vdW X‐ray source goes beyond what has been demonstrated so far. By introducing a tilt angle between the vdW structure and the incident electron beam, it is theoretically and experimentally shown that the accessible photon energy range is more than doubled. This allows for greater versatility in real‐time tuning of the vdW X‐ray source. Furthermore, this work shows that the accessible photon energy range is maximized by simultaneously controlling both the electron energy and the vdW structure tilt. These results will pave the way for highly tunable, compact X‐ray sources, with potential applications including hyperspectral X‐ray fluoroscopy and X‐ray quantum optics.},

The reason was their unique statistical and coherence properties. The emerging, short-wavelength free-electron lasers (FELs) are sources of very bright coherent extreme-ultraviolet and X-ray radiation with pulse durations on the order of femtoseconds, and are presently considered to be laser sources at these energies. FELs are highly spatially coherent to the first-order but in spite of their name, behave statistically as chaotic sources. Here, we demonstrate experimentally, by combining Hanbury Brown and Twiss interferometry with spectral measurements that the seeded XUV FERMI FEL-2 source does indeed behave statistically as a laser. The results may be useful for quantum optics experiments and for the design and operation of next generation FEL sources.},

	abstract = {Following optical excitations’ life span from creation to decay into photons is crucial in understanding materials photophysics. Macroscopically, this is studied using optical techniques, such as photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy. However, excitation and emission pathways can vary at nanometer scales, preventing direct access, as no characterization technique has the relevant spatial, spectral, and time resolution. Here, using combined electron spectroscopies, we explore excitations’ creation and decay in two representative optical materials: plasmonic nanoparticles and luminescent two-dimensional layers. The analysis of the energy lost by an exciting electron that is coincident in time with a visible-ultraviolet photon unveils the decay pathways from excitation toward light emission. This is demonstrated for phase-locked (coherent) interactions (localized surface plasmons) and non–phase-locked ones (point defect excited states). The developed cathodoluminescence excitation spectroscopy images energy transfer pathways at the nanometer scale, widening the available toolset to explore nanoscale materials. , Nanosecond temporal electron-based nano-optical coincidence techniques reveals energy transfer pathways},

The resonant excitation of the modes is evidenced from the characteristic set of coupling angles as well as the observed far-field pattern.

Not long ago an approach called in-line holography based on simple propagation became possible using partially coherent synchrotron beams like the ones available at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). Theoretical and experimental work by Cloetens et al. [Appl. Phys. Lett 75, 2912 (1999)] have shown that quantitative retrieval of the optical phase, from a set of radiographs taken at different sample-to-detector distances, is feasible. Mathematically speaking we are dealing with a direct method based on linearization in order to solve an inverse nonlinear problem. The phase retrieval can be combined with classical tomography in order to obtain a three-dimensional representation of the object’s electron density (holotomography). In order to optimize the image contrast for the numerical phase retrieval process, we have carried out calculations resulting in an optimized choice of value and number of the sample-to-detector distances as well as of the photon energy. These results were then confirmed by experiments on the ESRF long beamline ID19.},

However, quantitative retrieval of the sample's image remains challenging, imposing constraints on the nature of the sample or on the propagation distance. Here, we present a way of simultaneously retrieving the sample's complex-valued transmission function and the incident illumination function from near-field diffraction patterns. The procedure relies on the measurement diversity created by lateral translations of the sample with respect to a structured illumination. The reconstruction approach, in essence identical to that employed in ptychography, is applied to hard X-ray synchrotron measurements and to simulations. Compared to other inline holography techniques, we expect near-field ptychography to reduce reconstruction artefacts by factoring out wavefront imperfections and relaxing constraints on the sample's scattering properties, thus ultimately improving the robustness of propagation-based X-ray phase tomography.},

A focused synchrotron beam is efficiently coupled into the input channel. The beam is guided and split into two channels with a controlled (and tunable) distance at the exit of the waveguide chip. After free-space propagation and diffraction broadening, the two beams interfere and form a double-slit interference pattern in the far-field. From the recorded far-field, the near-field was reconstructed by a phase retrieval algorithm (error reduction), which was found to be extremely reliable for the two-channel setting. By numerical propagation methods, the reconstructed field was then propagated along the optical axis, to investigate the formation of the interference pattern from the two overlapping beams. Interestingly, phase vortices were observed and analysed.},

	abstract = {A novel 1‐D X‐ray waveguide, the Mo/C waveguide array (WGA), is introduced to tailor the optical near field distribution by precisely designed and controlled multi‐beam interference at 19.9 keV hard X‐ray energy. Seven precisely controlled guiding layers with optimized layer thickness variation were fabricated by high‐precision direct‐current magnetron sputtering of amorphous carbon (C) and molybdenum (Mo). The thickness variations are designed in such a way to introduce the desired phase shifts between the guided output beams, to act as a quasi‐focusing device. The WGA and the layer thicknesses are characterized by X‐ray reflectivity, transmission electron microscopy, and measurement of the synchrotron radiation far‐field intensity pattern. Based on the measurements and simulations, a reliable Mo/C multilayer layers combination can be verified. With the layers thicknesses, simulations inside the WGA and in the optical near field behind it show that multi‐beam interference with the designed phase shifts lead to a relative beam intensity of 0.59 in a quasi‐focal plane 0.08 mm behind the exit, with a spot size of 23.8 nm.

First, the phase-retrieval algorithms are extended by an optimized deterministic inversion, based on a multi-distance recording. Second, different advanced forms of iterative phase retrieval are used, operational for single-distance and multi-distance recordings. Results are compared for several different preparations of macrophage cells, for different staining and labelling. As a result, it is shown that phase retrieval is no longer a bottleneck for holographic imaging of cells, and how advanced schemes can be implemented to cope also with high noise and inconsistencies in the data.},

Artifacts are often encountered due to the strong focusing required to reach high resolution. Here, two schemes for reconstructing the complex-valued and extended wavefront of X-ray nano-probes, primarily in the planes relevant for imaging ( i.e. focus, sample and detection plane), are presented and compared. Firstly, near-field ptychography is used, based on scanning a test pattern laterally as well as longitudinally along the optical axis. Secondly, any test pattern is dispensed of and the wavefront reconstructed only from data recorded for different longitudinal translations of the detector. For this purpose, an optimized multi-plane projection algorithm is presented, which can cope with the numerically very challenging setting of a divergent wavefront emanating from a hard X-ray nanoprobe. The results of both schemes are in very good agreement. The probe retrieval can be used as a tool for optics alignment, in particular at X-ray nanoprobe beamlines. Combining probe retrieval and object reconstruction is also shown to improve the image quality of holographic near-field imaging.},

For high resolution synchrotron experiments, phase retrieval is largely based on the single step reconstruction using the contrast transfer function approach (CTF), as introduced almost twenty years ago [Cloetens et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 75, 2912 (1999)]. Notwithstanding its tremendous merits, this scheme makes stringent assumptions on the optical properties of the object, requiring, in particular, a weakly varying phase. In this work, we show how significant the loss in image quality becomes if these assumption are violated, and how phase retrieval can be easily improved by a simple scheme of alternating projections. Importantly, the approach demonstrated here uses the same input data and constraint sets as the conventional CTF-based phase retrieval, and is particularly well suited for the holographic regime.},

The paucity of structural probes that are sensitive to nanometer-thick films and also capable of in-operando conditions with high spatiotemporal resolutions limits the understanding of morphology and dynamics in ultrathin films. Similar to X-ray fluorescence holography for crystals, where holograms are formed through the interference between the reference and the object waves, we demonstrated that an ultrathin film, being an X-ray waveguide, can also generate fluorescence holograms as a result of the establishment of X-ray standing waves. Coupled with model-independent reconstruction algorithms based on rigorous dynamical scattering theories, the thin-film-based X-ray waveguide fluorescence holography becomes a unique in situ and time-resolved imaging probe capable of elucidating the real-time nanostructure kinetics with unprecedented resolutions. Combined with chemical sensitive spectroscopic analysis, the reconstruction can yield element-specific morphology of embedding nanostructures in ultrathin films.},

In this work, a much larger set of algorithms, which covers a wide range of cases (experimental parameters, objects and constraints), is compiled into a single toolbox – the HoloTomoToolbox – which is made publicly available.

In this work, we show full-field holographic x-ray imaging based on cone-beam illumination, beyond the resolution limit given by the cone-beam numerical aperture. Image information encoded in far-field diffraction and in holographic self-interference is treated in a common reconstruction scheme, without the usual empty beam correction step of in-line holography. An illumination profile tailored by waveguide optics and exactly known by prior probe retrieval is shown to be sufficient for solving the phase problem. The approach paves the way toward high-resolution and dose-efficient x-ray tomography, well suited for the current upgrades of synchrotron radiation sources to diffraction-limited storage rings.},

This is of particular importance for spectral ranges where suitable lenses are challenging, such as for hard x-rays. Here, we propose a phase retrieval approach for inline x-ray holography based on Tikhonov regularization applied to the full nonlinear forward model of image formation. The approach can be seen as a nonlinear generalization of the well-established contrast transfer function (CTF) reconstruction method. While similar methods have been proposed before, the current work achieves nonlinear, constrained phase retrieval at competitive computation times. We thus enable high-throughput imaging of optically strong objects beyond the scope of CTF. Using different examples of inline holograms obtained from illumination by a x-ray waveguide-source, we demonstrate superior image quality even for samples which do not obey the assumption of a weakly varying phase. Since the presented approach does not rely on linearization, we expect it to be well suited also for other probes such as visible light or electrons, which often exhibit strong phase interaction.},

Sub-10 nm and even sub-5 nm focal spot sizes have already been achieved using multilayer optics such as multilayer Laue lenses and multilayer zone plates. However these optics can not be described by the kinematic theory given their extreme aspect-ratio between the depth (thickness) and the layer width. Moreover, the numerical simulation of these optics is challenging, and the absence of an accessible numerical framework inhibits further progress in their design and utilization. Here, we simulate the propagation of x-ray wavefields within and behind optical multilayer elements using a finite-difference propagation method. We show that the method offers high accuracy at reasonable computational cost. We investigate how small focal spot sizes and highest diffraction efficiency of multilayer optics can be achieved, considering volume diffraction effects such as waveguiding and Pendellösung. Finally, we show the simulation of a novel imaging scheme, allowing for a detailed study of image formation and the development of customized phase retrieval schemes.},

X-ray waveguides are weakly guiding and experience significant material absorption, such that the established waveguide theory is not immediately applicable. Here, a general self-contained nano-optical theory of planar waveguides is derived, which is appropriate for hard x-ray energies. Solutions of the electromagnetic fields and its Green’s functions are derived in detail. Asymptotic expansions into resonant and non-resonant modes are derived, which are particularly useful in the presence of strong material absorption. A method to reliably find the resonant modes of x-ray waveguide structures is presented. Based on the general theory, certain common experimental geometries, namely evanescent coupling in grazing-incidence, front-coupling in forward-incidence and radiation from buried emitters, are discussed in more detail. Complementing the analytic discussion, numerical tools are provided and applied to quantitatively extract the main figures of merit. The theory provides an analytic foundation for the interpretation of past and future experiments and, combined with the numerical tools, will facilitate the computer-aided design of x-ray waveguides.},

The corresponding laser fields are strong enough to compete with the Coulomb forces in controlling the dynamics of atomic systems and give rise to multiphoton processes. This book presents a unified account of this rapidly developing field of physics. The first part describes the fundamental phenomena occurring in intense laser-atom interactions and gives the basic theoretical framework to analyze them. The second part contains a detailed discussion of Floquet theory, the numerical integration of the wave equations and approximation methods for the low- and high-frequency regimes. In the third part, the main multiphoton processes are discussed: multiphoton ionization, high harmonic and attosecond pulse generation, and laser-assisted electron-atom collisions. Aimed at graduate students in atomic, molecular and optical physics, the book will also interest researchers working on laser interactions with matter.},

In the majority of these studies the harmonic generation process is described using semi-classical theories which treat the electromagnetic field of the driving laser pulse classically without taking into account its quantum nature. In addition, for the measurement of the generated harmonics, all the experiments require diagnostics in the extreme-ultraviolet spectral region. Here by treating the driving laser field quantum mechanically we reveal the quantum-optical nature of the high-order harmonic generation process by measuring the photon number distribution of the infrared light exiting the harmonic generation medium. It is found that the high-order harmonics are imprinted in the photon number distribution of the infrared light and can be recorded without the need of a spectrometer in the extreme-ultraviolet.},

	abstract = {The interaction of electrons with strong laser fields is usually treated with semiclassical theory, where the laser is represented by an external field. There are analytic solutions for the free electron wave functions, which incorporate the interaction with the laser field exactly, but the joint effect of the atomic binding potential presents an obstacle for the analysis. Moreover, the radiation is a dynamical system, the number of photons changes during the interactions. Thus, it is legitimate to ask how can one treat the high order processes nonperturbatively, in such a way that the electron-atom interaction and the quantized nature of radiation be simultaneously taken into account? An analytic method is proposed to answer this question in the framework of nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics. As an application, a quantum optical generalization of the strong-field Kramers-Heisenberg formula is derived for describing high-harmonic generation. Our formalism is suitable to analyse, among various quantal effects, the possible role of arbitrary photon statistics of the incoming field. The present paper is dedicated to the memory of Prof. Dr. Fritz Ehlotzky, who had significantly contributed to the theory of strong-field phenomena over many decades.},

Recently, high-harmonic generation has been observed in solids, which could lead to important applications such as all-optical methods to image valance charge density and reconstruct electronic band structures, as well as compact extreme ultraviolet light sources. So far these studies are confined to crystalline solids; therefore, decoupling the respective roles of long-range periodicity and high density has been challenging. Here we report the observation of high-harmonic generation from amorphous fused silica. We decouple the role of long-range periodicity by comparing harmonics generated from fused silica and crystalline quartz, which contain the same atomic constituents but differ in long-range periodicity. Our results advance current understanding of the strong-field processes leading to high-harmonic generation in solids with implications for the development of robust and compact extreme ultraviolet light sources.},

Typically performed in atomic gases, there is now interest in extending such a process to the solid state. Yoshikawa et al. pumped single-layer graphene with intense polarized pulses of infrared light to generate ultraviolet light, up to the ninth harmonic. Theoretical analysis of the process suggests that the effect could be transferred to other solid-state systems, providing a possible route to develop coherent light sources across the spectrum. Science , this issue p. 736 , High-harmonic generation is observed in single-layer graphene. , The electronic properties of graphene can give rise to a range of nonlinear optical responses. One of the most desirable nonlinear optical processes is high-harmonic generation (HHG) originating from coherent electron motion induced by an intense light field. Here, we report on the observation of up to ninth-order harmonics in graphene excited by mid-infrared laser pulses at room temperature. The HHG in graphene is enhanced by an elliptically polarized laser excitation, and the resultant harmonic radiation has a particular polarization. The observed ellipticity dependence is reproduced by a fully quantum mechanical treatment of HHG in solids. The zero-gap nature causes the unique properties of HHG in graphene, and our findings open up the possibility of investigating strong-field and ultrafast dynamics and nonlinear behavior of massless Dirac fermions.},

Here a metal-sapphire nanostructure is devised to provide a solid tip as the HHG emitter, replacing commonly used gaseous atoms. The fabricated solid tip is made of monocrystalline sapphire surrounded by a gold thin-film layer, and intended to produce EUV harmonics by the inter- and intra-band oscillations of electrons driven by the incident laser. The metal-sapphire nanostructure enhances the incident laser field by means of surface plasmon polaritons, triggering HHG directly from moderate femtosecond pulses of ∼0.1 TW cm −2 intensities. The measured EUV spectra exhibit odd-order harmonics up to ∼60 nm wavelengths without the plasma atomic lines typically seen when using gaseous atoms as the HHG emitter. This experimental outcome confirms that the plasmonic HHG approach is a promising way to realize coherent EUV sources for nano-scale near-field applications in spectroscopy, microscopy, lithography and atto-second physics.},

Sivis et al. now show that high harmonics can also be generated with a solid-state sample. They used nanofabricated structured targets of ZnO and varied the chemical composition of the sample to demonstrate that (modest) high harmonics can be generated as the light interacts with the target materials. The results present the possibility of developing solid-state ultrafast optical devices. Science , this issue p. 303 , Nanofabricated structures and chemical composition can tune the generation of high harmonics from solid-state targets. , The advent of high-harmonic generation in gases 30 years ago set the foundation for attosecond science and facilitated ultrafast spectroscopy in atoms, molecules, and solids. We explore high-harmonic generation in the solid state by means of nanostructured and ion-implanted semiconductors. We use wavelength-selective microscopic imaging to map enhanced harmonic emission and show that the generation medium and the driving field can be locally tailored in solids by modifying the chemical composition and morphology. This enables the control of high-harmonic technology within precisely engineered solid targets. We demonstrate customized high-harmonic wave fields with wavelengths down to 225 nanometers (ninth-harmonic order of 2-micrometer laser pulses) and present an integrated Fresnel zone plate target in silicon, which leads to diffraction-limited self-focusing of the generated harmonics down to 1-micrometer spot sizes.},

Here, we experimentally demonstrate metasurfaces as a superior way to focus EUV light. These devices exploit the fact that holes in a silicon membrane have a considerably larger refractive index than the surrounding material and efficiently vacuum-guide light with a wavelength of {\textbackslash}textasciitilde50 nanometers. This allows the transmission phase at the nanoscale to be controlled by the hole diameter. We fabricated an EUV metalens with a 10-millimeter focal length that supports numerical apertures of up to 0.05 and used it to focus ultrashort EUV light bursts generated by high-harmonic generation down to a 0.7-micrometer waist. Our approach introduces the vast light-shaping possibilities provided by dielectric metasurfaces to a spectral regime that lacks materials for transmissive optics. , Pushing metalenses to extremes The fields of ultrafast spectroscopy and semiconductor photolithography rely on very short wavelengths, typically in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) realm. However, most optical materials strongly absorb light in this wavelength regime, resulting in a lack of generally available transmissive components. Ossiander et al . designed and fabricated a metalens in which a carefully engineered array of holes in a thin silicon membrane focuses ultrafast EUV pulses close to the diffraction limit by “vacuum guiding.” The results open up transmissive optics to the EUV regime. —ISO , Metalens technology can be pushed into the extreme ultraviolet wavelength regime.},

Conventional models of HHG that treat the driving and emitted fields classically are usually very successful but inherently cannot capture the quantum-optical nature of the process. Although prior work considered quantum HHG, it remains unknown in what conditions the spectral and statistical properties of the radiation depart considerably from the known phenomenology of HHG. The discovery of such conditions could lead to novel sources of attosecond light having squeezing and entanglement. Here, we present a fully-quantum theory of extreme nonlinear optics, predicting quantum effects that alter both the spectrum and photon statistics of HHG, thus departing from all previous approaches. We predict the emission of shifted frequency combs and identify spectral features arising from the breakdown of the dipole approximation for the emission. Our results show that each frequency component of HHG can be bunched and squeezed and that each emitted photon is a superposition of all frequencies in the spectrum, i.e., each photon is a comb. Our general approach is applicable to a wide range of nonlinear optical processes, paving the way towards novel quantum phenomena in extreme nonlinear optics.},

Kelvin predicted that the semi-angle of the V-shaped wedge behind a ship moving in deep water region is 19.5°, independent of the ship's velocity. The predication has been challenged recently that the semi-angle would transit from the Kelvin angle to the Mach angle as the ship's velocity increases. In this paper, we show the graphene plasmons excited by a swift charged particle would have the similar phenomenon. When the velocity of the charged particle is relatively slow, the graphene plasmons excited would accumulate along the caustic boundary of the graphene plasmons pattern, forming the plasmonic Kelvin angle. At large velocity, however, no graphene plasmons would accumulate along any boundary, thereby the caustics disappear and the effective semi-angle of the graphene plasmons approaches the Mach angle.},

However, the conceptual three-dimensional invisibility cloak that exactly follows specifications of transformation optics is formidably difficult to implement, while the simplified cylindrical cloak that has been experimentally realized is inherently visible. On the other hand, the recent carpet cloak model has acquired remarkable experimental development, including a recently demonstrated full-parameter carpet cloak without any approximation in the required constitutive parameters. In this paper, we numerically investigate the electromagnetic radiation from a charged particle passing through a perfect carpet cloak and propose an experimentally verifiable model to demonstrate symmetry breaking of transformation optics.},

Transport of subwavelength electromagnetic (EM) energy has been achieved through near-field coupling of highly confined surface EM modes supported by plasmonic nanoparticles, in a configuration usually on a two-dimensional (2D) substrate. Vertical transport of similar modes along the third dimension, on the other hand, can bring more flexibility in designs of functional photonic devices, but this phenomenon has not been observed in reality. In this paper, designer (or spoof) surface plasmon resonators ('plasmonic meta-atoms') are stacked in the direction vertical to their individual planes in demonstrating vertical transport of subwavelength localized surface EM modes. The dispersion relation of this vertical transport is determined from coupled-mode theory and is verified with a near-field transmission spectrum and field mapping with a microwave near-field scanning stage. This work extends the near-field coupled resonator optical waveguide (CROW) theory into the vertical direction, and may find applications in novel three-dimensional slow-light structures, filters, and photonic circuits.},

After incorporating the ground plane, all resonance modes are red shifted with their Q factors enhanced. By increasing the separation from the planar resonator to the underneath ground plane, all enhanced modes are blue shifted with Q factors decreased slightly, whose trend is opposite to increasing the thickness of a dielectric substrate of a common meta-atom without a ground.

Recent advances in E-near-zero and anisotropic E-near-infinity metamaterials have provided unique possibilities of achieving reflectionless diffraction-free electromagnetic wave routing, but their designs are fundamentally limited to narrow bandwidths, and they have not been demonstrated in reality. Here we experimentally demonstrate broadband reflectionless diffraction-free routing of electromagnetic waves through two right-angled sharp corners in a bent microwave rectangular waveguide. An image with deep-subwavelength information is transported through the bent waveguide in a broad bandwidth. This Rapid Communication supplements and extends the current studies of metamaterials with extreme permittivities and can be useful for routing and interconnection of subwavelength photonic information.},

Acoustic technologies frequently develop in tandem with optics, using shared concepts such as waveguiding and metamedia. It is thus noteworthy that an entirely novel class of electromagnetic waves, known as "topological edge states," has recently been demonstrated. These are inspired by the electronic edge states occurring in topological insulators, and possess a striking and technologically promising property: the ability to travel in a single direction along a surface without backscattering, regardless of the existence of defects or disorder. Here, we develop an analogous theory of topological fluid acoustics, and propose a scheme for realizing topological edge states in an acoustic structure containing circulating fluids. The phenomenon of disorder-free one-way sound propagation, which does not occur in ordinary acoustic devices, may have novel applications for acoustic isolators, modulators, and transducers.},

It has been known from the classic work of Ginzburg and Frank that a superlight (that is, superluminal) normal Doppler effect14–18 appears inside the Vavilov–Cherenkov cone if the velocity of the source v is larger than the phase velocity of light vp. By further developing their theory, we discover that an inverse Doppler frequency shift will arise if v {\textgreater} 2vp. We denote this as the superlight inverse Doppler effect. Moreover, we show that the superlight inverse Doppler effect can be spatially separated from the other Doppler effects by using highly squeezed polaritons (such as graphene plasmons), which may facilitate the experimental observation.},

	abstract = {Realizing negative refraction of highly squeezed polaritons is an important step toward the active manipulation of light at the extreme nanoscale. To realize negative refraction, an effective means to tailor the coupling of different polaritons is absolutely necessary yet undeveloped. Here, we predict a viable way to flip the sign of group velocities of hybrid plasmon–phonon–polaritons in graphene–boron nitride (BN) heterostructures. The polaritonic strong coupling enables the all-angle negative refraction phenomena between highly squeezed graphene’s plasmons, BN’s phonon polaritons, and their hybrid polaritons. Due to the combined advantages of tunability, low loss, and ultrahigh confinement provided by these polaritons, graphene–BN heterostructures thus provide fundamental tools to explore the manipulation of light at the extreme nanoscale.A fundamental building block for nanophotonics is the ability to achieve negative refraction of polaritons, because this could enable the demonstration of many unique nanoscale applications such as deep-subwavelength imaging, superlens, and novel guiding. However, to achieve negative refraction of highly squeezed polaritons, such as plasmon polaritons in graphene and phonon polaritons in boron nitride (BN) with their wavelengths squeezed by a factor over 100, requires the ability to flip the sign of their group velocity at will, which is challenging. Here we reveal that the strong coupling between plasmon and phonon polaritons in graphene–BN heterostructures can be used to flip the sign of the group velocity of the resulting hybrid (plasmon–phonon–polariton) modes. We predict all-angle negative refraction between plasmon and phonon polaritons and, even more surprisingly, between hybrid graphene plasmons and between hybrid phonon polaritons. Graphene–BN heterostructures thus provide a versatile platform for the design of nanometasurfaces and nanoimaging elements.},

However, the amount of radiation that can ultimately be extracted from free electrons near an arbitrary material structure has remained elusive. Here we derive a fundamental upper limit to the spontaneous photon emission and energy loss of free electrons, regardless of geometry, which illuminates the effects of material properties and electron velocities. We obtain experimental evidence for our theory with quantitative measurements of Smith-Purcell radiation. Our framework allows us to make two predictions. One is a new regime of radiation operation-at subwavelength separations, slower (non-relativistic) electrons can achieve stronger radiation than fast (relativistic) electrons. The other is a divergence of the emission probability in the limit of loss-less materials. We further reveal that such divergences can be approached by coupling free electrons to photonic bound states in the continuum(11-13). Our findings suggest that compact and efficient free-electron radiation sources from microwaves to the soft X-ray regime may be achievable without requiring ultrahigh accelerating voltages.},

	abstract = {Transition radiation is a process of a rather general character. It occurs when some source, which does not have a proper frequency (for example, a charge) moves at a constant velocity in an inhomogeneous and (or) nonstationary medium or near such a medium. The simplest type of transition radiation takes place when a charge crosses a boundary between two media (the role of one of the media may be played by vacuum). In the case of periodic variation of the medium, transition radiation possesses some specific features (resonance transition radiation or transition scattering). Transition scattering occurs, in particular, when a permittivity wave falls onto an nonmoving (fixed) charge. Transition scattering is closely connected with transition bremsstrahlung radiation. All these transition processes are essential for plasma physics. Transition radiation and transition scattering have analogues outside the framework of electrodynamics (like in the case of Vavilov–Cherenkov radiation). In the present report the corresponding range of phenomena is elucidated, as far as possible, in a generally physical aspect.},

However, such future technologies call for means to both prepare and fully analyse the corresponding free-electron quantum states. Here, we introduce a framework for the preparation, coherent manipulation and characterization of free-electron quantum states, experimentally demonstrating attosecond electron pulse trains. Phase-locked optical fields coherently control the electron wavefunction along the beam direction. We establish a new variant of quantum state tomography-'SQUIRRELS'-for free-electron ensembles. The ability to tailor and quantitatively map electron quantum states will promote the nanoscale study of electron-matter entanglement and new forms of ultrafast electron microscopy down to the attosecond regime.},

Plasmon polaritons may enable many enigmatic quantum effects, including lasing 1 , topological protection2,3 and dipole-forbidden absorption 4 . A necessary condition for realizing such phenomena is a long plasmonic lifetime, which is notoriously difficult to achieve for highly confined modes 5 . Plasmon polaritons in graphene—hybrids of Dirac quasiparticles and infrared photons—provide a platform for exploring light–matter interaction at the nanoscale6,7. However, plasmonic dissipation in graphene is substantial 8 and its fundamental limits remain undetermined. Here we use nanometre-scale infrared imaging to investigate propagating plasmon polaritons in high-mobility encapsulated graphene at cryogenic temperatures. In this regime, the propagation of plasmon polaritons is primarily restricted by the dielectric losses of the encapsulated layers, with a minor contribution from electron–phonon interactions. At liquid-nitrogen temperatures, the intrinsic plasmonic propagation length can exceed 10 micrometres, or 50 plasmonic wavelengths, thus setting a record for highly confined and tunable polariton modes. Our nanoscale imaging results reveal the physics of plasmonic dissipation and will be instrumental in mitigating such losses in heterostructure engineering applications.},

In this paper, we present the experimental observation of visible light emission from low-energy free electrons interacting with nanoscale periodic surfaces through the Smith-Purcell (SP) effect. SP radiation is emitted when electrons pass in close proximity over a periodic structure, inducing collective charge motion or dipole excitations near the surface, thereby giving rise to electromagnetic radiation. We demonstrate a controlled emission of SP light from nanoscale gold gratings with periodicity as small as 50 nm, enabling the observation of visible SP radiation by low energy electrons (1.5 to 6 keV), an order of magnitude lower than previously reported. We study the emission wavelength and intensity dependence on the grating pitch and electron energy, showing agreement between experiment and theory. Further reduction of structure periodicity should enable the production of SP-based devices that operate with even slower electrons that allow an even smaller footprint and facilitate the investigation of quantum effects for light generation in nanoscale devices. A tunable light source integrated in an electron microscope would enable the development of novel electron-optical correlated spectroscopic techniques, with additional applications ranging from biological imaging to solid-state lighting.},

	abstract = {Metamaterials are artificial optical media composed of sub- wavelength metallic and dielectric building blocks that feature optical phenomena not present in naturally occurring materials. Although they can serve as the basis for unique optical devices that mould the flow of light in unconventional ways, three-dimensional metamaterials suffer from extreme propagation losses. Two- dimensional metamaterials (metasurfaces) such as hyperbolic metasurfaces for propagating surface plasmon polaritons have the potential to alleviate this problem. Because the surface plasmon polaritons are guided at a metal–dielectric interface (rather than passing through metallic components), these hyperbolic metasur- faces have been predicted to suffer much lower propagation loss while still exhibiting optical phenomena akin to those in three- dimensional metamaterials. Moreover, because of their planar nature, these devices enable the construction of integrated meta- material circuits as well as easy coupling with other optoelectronic elements. Here we report the experimental realization of a visible- frequency hyperbolic metasurface using single-crystal silver nano- structures defined by lithographic and etching techniques. The resulting devices display the characteristic properties of metamaterials, such as negative refraction and diffraction-free propagation, with device performance greatly exceeding those of previous demonstrations. Moreover, hyperbolic metasurfaces exhibit strong, dispersion-dependent spin–orbit coupling, enabling polarization- and wavelength-dependent routeing of surface plas- monpolaritons and two-dimensional chiraloptical components. These results open the door to realizing integrated optical meta- circuits, with wide-ranging applications in areas from imaging and sensing to quantum optics and quantum information science.},

	abstract = {The process of transition radiation is a very general one. It appears if some source, which does not have a proper frequency (for example a point charge, multipole etc.), is moving with a constant velocity in an inhomogeneous and/or nonstationary medium. In the case of a periodic medium the transition radiation has some special peculiarities and is called the resonance transition radiation or transition scattering. Transition scattering occurs particularly in the case when some wave of dielectric permitivity acts on a nonmoving (fixed) charge. The processes of transition radiation and transition scattering have analogies outside electrodynamics similarly to the Vavilov-Cherenkov emission. The latter occurs also for a source moving with a constant velocity but in a homogeneous medium (and only if the velocity of the source exceeds the wave phase velocity in the medium). The present review is dealing with several problems of the theory of transition radiation and transition scattering. Attention is paid mainly to the formulation of the problems and to revealing characteristic features and peculiarities of the phenomena described.},

The atomic scattering factors may be accurately determined from the atomic photoabsorption cross sections using modified Kramers-Kronig dispersion relations. From a synthesis of the currently available experimental data and recent theoretical calculations for photoabsorption, the angle-independent, forward-scattering components of the atomic scattering factors have been thus semiempirically determined and tabulated here for 92 elements and for the region 50-30,000 eV. Atomic scattering factors for all angles of coherent scattering and at the higher photon energies are obtained from these tabulated forward-scattering values by adding a simple angle-dependent form-factor correction. The incoherent scattering contributions that become significant for the light elements at the higher photon energies are similarly determined. The basic x-ray interaction relations that are used in applied x-ray physics are presented here in terms of the atomic scattering factors. The bulk optical constants are also related to the atomic scattering factors. These atomic and optical relations are applied to the detailed calculation of the reflectivity characteristics of a series of practical x-ray mirror, multilayer, and crystal monochromators. Comparisons of the results of this semiempirical, "atomic-like" description of x-ray interactions for the low-energy region with those of experiment and ab initio theory are presented.},

Nevertheless, because of the much smaller momenta of photons compared with electrons at similar energies, the optical environment typically modifies only the emission/absorption rates, leaving the emitter transition frequencies practically an intrinsic property. We show here that surface polaritons, exemplified by graphene plasmons, but also valid for other types of polariton, enable substantial and tunable control of the transition frequencies of a nearby quantum well, demonstrating a sharp break with the emitter-centric view. Central to this result is the large momenta of surface polaritons that can approach the momenta of electrons and impart a pronounced non-local behaviour to the quantum well. This work facilitates non-vertical optical transitions in solids and empowers ongoing efforts to access such transitions in indirect-bandgap materials, such as silicon, as well as enriching the study of non-locality in photonics.},

	abstract = {Many complex systems operate with loss. Mathematically, these systems can be described as non-Hermitian. A property of such a system is that there can exist certain conditions—exceptional points—where gain and loss can be perfectly balanced and exotic behavior is predicted to occur. Optical systems generally possess gain and loss and so are ideal systems for exploring exceptional point physics. Miri and Alù review the topic of exceptional points in photonics and explore some of the possible exotic behavior that might be expected from engineering such systems.Science, this issue p. eaar7709BACKGROUNDSingularities are critical points for which the behavior of a mathematical model governing a physical system is of a fundamentally different nature compared to the neighboring points. Exceptional points are spectral singularities in the parameter space of a system in which two or more eigenvalues, and their corresponding eigenvectors, simultaneously coalesce. Such degeneracies are peculiar features of nonconservative systems that exchange energy with their surrounding environment. In the past two decades, there has been a growing interest in investigating such nonconservative systems, particularly in connection with the quantum mechanics notions of parity-time symmetry, after the realization that some non-Hermitian Hamiltonians exhibit entirely real spectra. Lately, non-Hermitian systems have raised considerable attention in photonics, given that optical gain and loss can be integrated as nonconservative ingredients to create artificial materials and structures with altogether new optical properties.ADVANCESAs we introduce gain and loss in a nanophotonic system, the emergence of exceptional point singularities dramatically alters the overall response, leading to a range of exotic functionalities associated with abrupt phase transitions in the eigenvalue spectrum. Even though such a peculiar effect has been known theoretically for several years, its controllable realization has not been made possible until recently and with advances in exploiting gain and loss in guided-wave photonic systems. As shown in a range of recent theoretical and experimental works, this property creates opportunities for ultrasensitive measurements and for manipulating the modal content of multimode lasers. In addition, adiabatic parametric evolution around exceptional points provides interesting schemes for topological energy transfer and designing mode and polarization converters in photonics. Lately, non-Hermitian degeneracies have also been exploited for the design of laser systems, new nonlinear optics phenomena, and exotic scattering features in open systems.OUTLOOKThus far, non-Hermitian systems have been largely disregarded owing to the dominance of the Hermitian theories in most areas of physics. Recent advances in the theory of non-Hermitian systems in connection with exceptional point singularities has revolutionized our understanding of such complex systems. In the context of optics and photonics, in particular, this topic is highly important because of the ubiquity of nonconservative elements of gain and loss. In this regard, the theoretical developments in the field of non-Hermitian physics have allowed us to revisit some of the well-established platforms with a new angle of utilizing gain and loss as new degrees of freedom, in stark contrast with the traditional approach of avoiding these elements. On the experimental front, progress in fabrication technologies has allowed for harnessing gain and loss in chip-scale photonic systems. These theoretical and experimental developments have put forward new schemes for controlling the functionality of micro- and nanophotonic devices. This is mainly based on the anomalous parameter dependence in the response of non-Hermitian systems when operating around exceptional point singularities. Such effects can have important ramifications in controlling light in new nanophotonic device designs, which are fundamentally based on engineering the interplay of coupling and dissipation and amplification mechanisms in multimode systems. Potential applications of such designs reside in coupled-cavity laser sources with better coherence properties, coupled nonlinear resonators with engineered dispersion, compact polarization and spatial mode converters, and highly efficient reconfigurable diffraction surfaces. In addition, the notion of the exceptional point provides opportunities to take advantage of the inevitable dissipation in environments such as plasmonic and semiconductor materials, which play a key role in optoelectronics. Finally, emerging platforms such as optomechanical cavities provide opportunities to investigate exceptional points and their associated phenomena in multiphysics systems.Ubiquity of non-Hermitian systems, supporting exceptional points, in photonics.(A) A generic non-Hermitian optical system involving two coupled modes with different detuning, ±ω1,2, and gain-loss values, ±γ1,2, coupled at rate of μ.

HODAEI ET AL., SCIENCE 346, 975 (2014); IMAGE IN (D) BASED ON CONCEPTS FROM W. CHEN ET AL., NATURE 548, 192 (2017).Exceptional points are branch point singularities in the parameter space of a system at which two or more eigenvalues, and their corresponding eigenvectors, coalesce and become degenerate. Such peculiar degeneracies are distinct features of non-Hermitian systems, which do not obey conservation laws because they exchange energy with the surrounding environment. Non-Hermiticity has been of great interest in recent years, particularly in connection with the quantum mechanical notion of parity-time symmetry, after the realization that Hamiltonians satisfying this special symmetry can exhibit entirely real spectra. These concepts have become of particular interest in photonics because optical gain and loss can be integrated and controlled with high resolution in nanoscale structures, realizing an ideal playground for non-Hermitian physics, parity-time symmetry, and exceptional points. As we control dissipation and amplification in a nanophotonic system, the emergence of exceptional point singularities dramatically alters their overall response, leading to a range of exotic optical functionalities associated with abrupt phase transitions in the eigenvalue spectrum. These concepts enable ultrasensitive measurements, superior manipulation of the modal content of multimode lasers, and adiabatic control of topological energy transfer for mode and polarization conversion. Non-Hermitian degeneracies have also been exploited in exotic laser systems, new nonlinear optics schemes, and exotic scattering features in open systems. Here we review the opportunities offered by exceptional point physics in photonics, discuss recent developments in theoretical and experimental research based on photonic exceptional points, and examine future opportunities in this area from basic science to applied technology.},

	title = {On the theory of transition radiation in a nonstationary medium},
	abstract = {A theory of transition radiation in a medium with a time-varying refractive index (which is assumed to vary in a steplike manner) is developed. Along with the radiation field and energy (including the relativistic case), calculations are performed for the work of the radiative friction on the radiating particle and also for the change in energy of the field dragged by the particle. Transition radiation was first studied in a case when a uniformly moving charged particle crossed an abrupt interface between two media[1J. Subsequently, a number of other problems of transition-radiation theory was also investigated (see the reviews[2,3 J), and transition radia-tion produced in a homogeneous medium when its proper-ties change abruptly in time has recently attracted attention [4J. Such a possibility is clear already from the general considerations that lead to the conclusion that transition radiation exists. Indeed, in a medium with refractive index N = (1/2 the radiation is produced when the parameter vN/c changes with time (v is the particle velocity and c is the speed of light in vacuum; the case of Cerenkov radiation is not considered at pres-ent). An important role is played here by the change of this parameter at a spot occupied by a charge (or by some other emitter). It is obvious that at constant veloc-ity v the parameter vN/c varies both in a spatially in-homogeneous medium (the usual transition radiauon) and in a spatially homogeneous medium but one in which N varies with time. This type of transition radiation has its own peculiarities and does not reduce by far to tran-sition radiation in a spatially inhomogeneous medium. We note that transition radiation in a medium that varies in time and in space sinusoidally was considered in [5J . We discuss in this article the problem of transition radiation in a non stationary medium with an abrupt var-iation of N with time, and examine the region of applica-bility of such an. approximation for variation of the re-fractive index in a dispersive medium. We estimate the time of formation of the radiation. We discuss in con-siderable detail the radiation of an ultrarelativistic par-ticle. We also calculate the work done by the radiation force on a radiating particle, and take into account the effect of particle-mass renormalization in a medium with variable parameters. Finally, we carry out a com-parison with the usual transition radiation for an inter-face between two media.},

The relevant vectorial electromagnetic problem is reduced to two two-dimensional scalar ones. A Green’s-function formulation of the two problems is employed. For both cases, an integral equation of the second kind for the remaining unknown function is derived. This integral equation is solved numerically by a method of moments. Some numerical results for the radiation from a moving point charge above a sinusoidal grating are presented; in particular, the power losses of the point charge have been estimated.},

	abstract = {The response of gold nanoparticle dimers is studied theoretically near and beyond the limit where the particles are touching. As the particles approach each other, a dominant dipole feature is observed that is pushed into the infrared due to interparticle coupling and that is associated with a large pileup of induced charge in the interparticle gap. The redshift becomes singular as the particle separation decreases. The response weakens for very small separation when the coupling across the interparticle gap becomes so strong that dipolar oscillations across the pair are inhibited. Lower-wavelength, higher-order modes show a similar separation dependence in nearly touching dimers. After touching, singular behavior is observed through the emergence of a new infrared absorption peak, also accompanied by huge charge pileup at the interparticle junction, if initial interparticle contact is made at a single point. This new mode is distinctly different from the lowest mode of the separated dimer. When the junction is made by contact between flat surfaces, charge at the junction is neutralized and mode evolution is continuous through contact. The calculated singular response explains recent experiments on metallic nanoparticle dimers and is relevant in the design of nanoparticle-based sensors and plasmon circuits.},

While the kinetic Abraham–Poynting momentum describes the energy flux and the group velocity of the wave, the Minkowski-type quantities, with proper dispersion corrections, describe the actual momentum and AM carried by the wave. The kinetic Minkowski-type momentum and AM densities agree with phenomenological results derived by Philbin. Using the canonical spin–orbital decomposition, previously used for free-space fields, we find the corresponding canonical momentum, spin and orbital AM of light in a dispersive inhomogeneous medium. These acquire a very natural form analogous to the Brillouin energy density and are valid for arbitrary structured fields. The general theory is applied to a non-trivial example of a surface plasmon-polariton (SPP) wave at a metal-vacuum interface. We show that the integral momentum of the SPP per particle corresponds to the SPP wave vector, and hence exceeds the momentum of a photon in the vacuum. We also provide the first accurate calculation of the transverse spin and orbital AM of the SPP. While the intrinsic orbital AM vanishes, the transverse spin can change its sign depending on the SPP frequency. Importantly, we present both macroscopic and microscopic calculations, thereby proving the validity of the general phenomenological results. The microscopic theory also predicts a transverse magnetization in the metal (i.e. a magnetic moment for the SPP) as well as the corresponding direct magnetization current, which provides the difference between the Abraham and Minkowski momenta.},

We make a relativistic single-electron wavepacket interact in free-space with a semi-infinite light field generated by two light pulses reflected from a mirror and delayed by fractions of the optical cycle. The amplitude and phase of the resulting electron–state coherent oscillations are mapped in energy-momentum space via momentum-resolved ultrafast electron spectroscopy. The experimental results are in full agreement with our analytical theory, which predicts access to the zeptosecond timescale by adopting semi-infinite X-ray pulses.},

	abstract = {Electron imaging in space and time is achieved in microscopy with timed (near relativistic) electron packets of picometer wavelength coincident with light pulses of femtosecond duration. The photons (with an energy of a few electronvolts) are used to impulsively heat or excite the specimen so that the evolution of structures from their nonequilibrium state can be followed in real time. As such, and at relatively low fluences, there is no interaction between the electrons and the photons; certainly that is the case in vacuum because energy–momentum conservation is not possible. In the presence of nanostructures and at higher fluences, energy–momentum conservation is possible and the electron packet can either gain or lose light quanta. Recently, it was reported that, when only electrons with gained energy are filtered, near-field imaging enables the visualization of nanoscale particles and interfaces with enhanced contrast (Barwick et al 2009 Nature 462 902). To explore a variety of applications, it is important to express, through analytical formulation, the key parameters involved in this photon-induced near-field electron microscopy (PINEM) and to predict the associated phenomena of, e.g., forty-photon absorption by the electron packet. In this paper, we give an account of the theoretical and experimental results of PINEM. In particular, the time-dependent quantum solution for ultrafast electron packets in the nanostructure scattered electromagnetic (near) field is solved in the high kinetic energy limit to obtain the evolution of the incident electron packet into a superposition of discrete momentum wavelets. The characteristic length and time scales of the halo of electron–photon coupling are discussed in the framework of Rayleigh and Mie scatterings, providing the dependence of the PINEM effect on size, polarization, material and spatiotemporal localization. We also provide a simple classical description that is based on features of plasmonics. A major part of this paper is devoted to the comparisons between the theoretical results and the recently obtained experimental findings about the imaging of materials and biological systems.},

However, even though lensless x-ray ghost imaging was anticipated more than a decade ago, its development has been hampered due to the lack of suitable optics. The image quality is proportional to the total flux in conventional projection x-ray imaging, but high photon energy could severely damage the object being imaged, so decreasing the radiation dose while maintaining image quality is a fundamental problem. Using a simple tabletop x-ray source, we have successfully realized ghost imaging of planar and natural objects with a much higher contrast-to-noise ratio compared to projection x-ray imaging at the same low-radiation dose. Ultra-low-flux imaging has been achieved, and thus radiation damage of biological specimens could be greatly reduced with this new technique.},

Conventional methods for polarization control are limited to narrow bandwidth and often with low efficiency. Here, based on theoretical and experimental studies, we demonstrate that the two-colour laser scheme in gas plasma can provide effective control of elliptically polarized terahertz waves, including their ellipticity, azimuthal angle and chirality. This is achieved with a circularly polarized laser at the fundamental frequency and its linearly polarized second harmonic, a controlled phase difference between these two laser components, as well as a suitable length of the laser plasma filament. Flexible control of ellipticity and azimuthal angle is demonstrated with our theoretical model and systematic experiments. This offers a unique and flexible technique on the polarization control of broadband terahertz radiation suitable for a wide range of applications.},

Optical multiplexing frequency, brightness, and polarization have played crucial roles in information technologies, high-capacity data storage, high-speed communications, and biological sensing. Angular momentum is another degree of freedom that could increase capacity further. Typically, however, the bulk optical elements used to determine the angular momentum of light limit possible on-chip processing. Ren et al. take a nanophotonics approach to measure and sort light co-propagating with different states of angular momentum (see the Perspective by Molina-Terriza). The approach is promising for on-chip multiplex processing of optical signals.Science, this issue p. 805; see also p. 774Angular momentum division has emerged as a physically orthogonal multiplexing method in high-capacity optical information technologies. However, the typical bulky elements used for information retrieval from the overall diffracted field, based on the interference method, impose a fundamental limit toward realizing on-chip multiplexing. We demonstrate noninterference angular momentum multiplexing by using a mode-sorting nanoring aperture with a chip-scale footprint as small as 4.2 micrometers by 4.2 micrometers, where nanoring slits exhibit a distinctive outcoupling efficiency on tightly confined plasmonic modes. The nonresonant mode-sorting sensitivity and scalability of our approach enable on-chip parallel multiplexing over a bandwidth of 150 nanometers in the visible wavelength range. The results offer the possibility of ultrahigh-capacity and miniaturized nanophotonic devices harnessing angular momentum division.},

The vortex structure of the resulting electron wavepacket is probed in both real and reciprocal space using ultrafast transmission electron microscopy. This method offers a high degree of scalability to small length scales and a highly efficient manipulation of the electron vorticity with attosecond precision. Besides the direct implications in the investigation of nanoscale ultrafast processes in which chirality plays a major role, we further discuss the perspectives of using this technique to shape the wavefunction of charged composite particles, such as protons, and how it can be used to probe their internal structure.},

Now, Chakraborty et al. have combined an atomically thin graphene sheet with terahertz quantum cascade lasers to realize a terahertz laser that can be tuned via the carrier doping level of the graphene layer (see the Perspective by Polini). The demonstration opens up the possibility of reversible control over the laser emission through the integration of graphene waveguides.Science, this issue p. 246; see also p. 229Two-dimensional graphene plasmon-based technologies will enable the development of fast, compact, and inexpensive active photonic elements because, unlike plasmons in other materials, graphene plasmons can be tuned via the doping level. Such tuning is harnessed within terahertz quantum cascade lasers to reversibly alter their emission. This is achieved in two key steps: first, by exciting graphene plasmons within an aperiodic lattice laser and, second, by engineering photon lifetimes, linking graphene’s Fermi energy with the round-trip gain. Modal gain and hence laser spectra are highly sensitive to the doping of an integrated, electrically controllable, graphene layer. Demonstration of the integrated graphene plasmon laser principle lays the foundation for a new generation of active, programmable plasmonic metamaterials with major implications across photonics, material sciences, and nanotechnology.},

Here, we provide direct evidence of the role of structural dynamics, with selective atomic motions (buckling of copper–oxygen planes), in the anisotropic electron-lattice coupling. The transient structures were determined using time-resolved electron diffraction, following carrier excitation with polarized femtosecond heating pulses, and examined for different dopings and temperatures. The deformation amplitude reaches 0.5\% of the c axis value of 30 Å when the light polarization is in the direction of the copper–oxygen bond, but its decay slows down at 45°. These findings suggest a selective dynamical lattice involvement with the anisotropic electron–phonon coupling being on a time scale (1–3.5 ps depending on direction) of the same order of magnitude as that of the spin exchange of electron pairing in the high-temperature superconducting phase.},

	abstract = {In recent decades, scientists have developed the means to engineer synthetic periodic arrays with feature sizes below the wavelength of light. When such features are appropriately structured, electromagnetic radiation can be manipulated in unusual ways, resulting in optical metamaterials whose function is directly controlled through nanoscale structure. Nature, too, has adopted such techniques—for example in the unique colouring of butterfly wings—to manipulate photons as they propagate through nanoscale periodic assemblies. In this Perspective, we highlight the intriguing potential of designer structuring of electronic matter at scales at and below the electron wavelength, which affords a new range of synthetic quantum metamaterials with unconventional responses. Driven by experimental developments in stacking atomically layered heterostructures—such as mechanical pick-up/transfer assembly—atomic-scale registrations and structures can be readily tuned over distances smaller than characteristic electronic length scales (such as the electron wavelength, screening length and electron mean free path). Yet electronic metamaterials promise far richer categories of behaviour than those found in conventional optical metamaterial technologies. This is because, unlike photons, which scarcely interact with each other, electrons in subwavelength-structured metamaterials are charged and strongly interact. As a result, an enormous variety of emergent phenomena can be expected and radically new classes of interacting quantum metamaterials designed.},

The appropriate conditions for generation of good monochromatic hard X-ray fields by PXR were obtained with the LINAC by theoretical calculations and experiments. The PXR intensity increased approximately linearly with the electron energy in the electron energy range of several tens of MeV. The PXR energy increased linearly with the crystal rotation angle that depended on the reflection plane and the observation angle and did not depend on the electron energy. The obtained counts of PXR increased at large observation angles although the energy decreased. The experiments used Si plates with thicknesses of 200, 300, 400, 500, 530, and 625μm. Differences in angular distribution by the thickness of the Si plates were established. The possibility for PXR applications to material research and other fields is discussed. The off angle of the polished (cut) plane of the crystal was accurately determined using the PXR and the attenuation coefficient around the K-shell absorption edge of Zr, Nb and Mo were measured.},

In our theoretical model, the electrons interact with a surface harmonic wave excited near the diffraction grating when the electron velocity is almost equal to the phase velocity of the surface wave. Then, the surface harmonic wave is electromagnetically coupled to a radiation mode. The dynamics of electrons are analyzed quantum mechanically where the electron is represented as a traveling electron wave with a finite spreading length. The conversion of the surface wave into a propagating mode is analyzed using the classical Maxwell׳s equations. In the small-signal gain regime, closed-form expressions for the contributions of the stimulated and spontaneous emissions to the evolution of the surface wave are derived. The inclusion of the spreading length of the electron wave to the emission spectral line is investigated. Finally, we compare our results based on the quantum mechanical description of electron and those based on the classical approach where a good agreement is confirmed.},

	abstract = {Due to their unique band structure, single layers of transition metal dichalcogenides are promising for new atomic-scale physics and devices. It has been shown that the band structure and the excitonic transitions can be tuned by straining the material. Recently, the discovery of single-photon emission from localized excitons has put monolayer WSe2 in the spotlight. The localized light emitters might be related to local strain potentials in the monolayer. Here, we measure strain-dependent energy shifts for the A, B, C, and D excitons for uniaxial tensile strain up to 1.4\% in monolayer WSe2 by performing absorption measurements. A gauge factor of and is derived for the A, B, C, and D exciton, respectively. These values are in good agreement with ab initio GW-BSE calculations. Furthermore, we examine the spatial strain distribution in the WSe2 monolayer at different applied strain levels. We find that the size of the monolayer is crucial for an efficient transfer of strain from the substrate to the monolayer.},

	abstract = {This chapter discusses the radiation by uniformly moving sources. The motion of sources at a constant velocity is of great importance in the electrodynamics of continuous media, particularly in plasma. The chapter discusses the radiation of a source, moving uniformly in or near a medium. The quantum theory of the Vavilov-Cherenkov effect is considered. When a source moves uniformly and rectilinearly in a medium with a velocity, Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation occurs. When the medium is spatially homogeneous and time-independent, only the Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation is possible. Energy losses because of the Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation contribute to the total losses, called “ionization losses.” The Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation in a transparent medium is separated from the total losses, as it can go far from the source trajectory. Transition radiation is produced when a charge moves uniformly and in a straight line under nonuniform conditions. Transition radiation, transition scattering, and transition Bremsstrahlung play a particularly important role in connection with plasma.},

In this case, a single high-power (100 TW) laser system generates intense laser pulses, which are used for both electron acceleration and scattering. Although such all-laser-based sources have been demonstrated to be bright and energetic in proof-of-principle experiments7,8,9,10, to date they have lacked several important distinguishing characteristics of conventional Compton sources. We now report the experimental demonstration of all-laser-driven Compton X-rays that are both quasi-monoenergetic (∼50\% full-width at half-maximum) and tunable (∼70 keV to {\textgreater}1 MeV).

	abstract = {Laser-wakefield accelerators (LWFAs) were proposed more than three decades ago, and while they promise to deliver compact, high energy particle accelerators, they will also provide the scientific community with novel light sources. In a LWFA, where an intense laser pulse focused onto a plasma forms an electromagnetic wave in its wake, electrons can be trapped and are now routinely accelerated to GeV energies. From terahertz radiation to gamma-rays, this article reviews light sources from relativistic electrons produced by LWFAs, and discusses their potential applications. Betatron motion, Compton scattering and undulators respectively produce x-rays or gamma-rays by oscillating relativistic electrons in the wakefield behind the laser pulse, a counter-propagating laser field, or a magnetic undulator. Other LWFA-based light sources include bremsstrahlung and terahertz radiation. We first evaluate the performance of each of these light sources, and compare them with more conventional approaches, including radio frequency accelerators or other laser-driven sources. We have then identified applications, which we discuss in details, in a broad range of fields: medical and biological applications, military, defense and industrial applications, and condensed matter and high energy density science.},

However, the thermal transport properties in TMDs are not well understood due to the challenges in characterizing anisotropic thermal conductivity. Here, a variable-spot-size time-domain thermoreflectance approach is developed to simultaneously measure both the in-plane and the through-plane thermal conductivity of four kinds of layered TMDs (MoS2, WS2, MoSe2, and WSe2) over a wide temperature range, 80?300 K. Interestingly, it is found that both the through-plane thermal conductivity and the Al/TMD interface conductance depend on the modulation frequency of the pump beam for all these four compounds. The frequency-dependent thermal properties are attributed to the nonequilibrium thermal resistance between the different groups of phonons in the substrate. A two-channel thermal model is used to analyze the nonequilibrium phonon transport and to derive the intrinsic thermal conductivity at the thermal equilibrium limit. The measurements of the thermal conductivities of bulk TMDs serve as an important benchmark for understanding the thermal conductivity of single- and few-layer TMDs.},

The transformation, achieved by exposing non-vdW solids to chalcogen vapours, can be controlled using the enthalpies and vapour pressures of the reaction products. Heteroatom-substituted (such as yttrium and phosphorus) transition-metal chalcogenides can also be synthesized in this way, thus enabling a generic synthesis approach to engineering phase-selected 2D transition-metal chalcogenide structures with good stability at high temperatures (up to 1,373 kelvin) and achieving high-throughput production of monolayers. We anticipate that these 2D transition-metal chalcogenides will have broad applications for electronics, catalysis and energy storage.},

	abstract = {Today, it is well known that light possesses a linear momentum that is along the propagation direction. Besides, scientists also discovered that light can possess an angular momentum, a spin angular momentum (SAM) associated with circular polarization and an orbital angular momentum (OAM) owing to the azimuthally dependent phase. Even though such angular momenta are longitudinal in general, an SAM transverse to the propagation direction has opened up a variety of key applications1. In contrast, investigations of the transverse OAM are rare due to its complex nature. Here, we demonstrate a three-dimensional wave packet that is a spatiotemporal (ST) optical vortex with a controllable purely transverse OAM. Contrary to the transverse SAM, the magnitude of the transverse OAM carried by the ST vortex is scalable to a larger value by simple adjustments. Since the ST vortex carries a controllable OAM uniquely in the transverse dimension, it has strong potential for novel applications that may not be possible otherwise. The scheme reported here can be readily adapted for other spectral regimes and different wave fields, opening opportunities for the study and applications of ST vortices in a wide range of areas.},

Although the small footprint and on-chip integration are accessible, the trade-off between low energy consumption and high speed has been challenging. Huang et al. exploited the idea of bound states in the continuum, effectively a high–quality (Q) cavity without the physical cavity, to design vortex lasers with highly directional output and single-mode operation. With the trade-off between low energy consumption and high speed now broken, it should be possible to realize ultrafast optical switching that meets all the requirements of modern classic and quantum information.Science, this issue p. 1018The development of classical and quantum information–processing technology calls for on-chip integrated sources of structured light. Although integrated vortex microlasers have been previously demonstrated, they remain static and possess relatively high lasing thresholds, making them unsuitable for high-speed optical communication and computing. We introduce perovskite-based vortex microlasers and demonstrate their application to ultrafast all-optical switching at room temperature. By exploiting both mode symmetry and far-field properties, we reveal that the vortex beam lasing can be switched to linearly polarized beam lasing, or vice versa, with switching times of 1 to 1.5 picoseconds and energy consumption that is orders of magnitude lower than in previously demonstrated all-optical switching. Our results provide an approach that breaks the long-standing trade-off between low energy consumption and high-speed nanophotonics, introducing vortex microlasers that are switchable at terahertz frequencies.},

Here, using time-resolved photocurrent measurements, we identify an efficient out-of-plane energy transfer channel, where charge carriers in graphene couple to hyperbolic phonon polaritons17–19in the encapsulating layered material. This hyperbolic cooling is particularly efficient, giving picosecond cooling times for hexagonal BN, where the high-momentum hyperbolic phonon polaritons enable efficient near-field energy transfer.

	abstract = {Abstract The interaction of electrons with strong electromagnetic fields is fundamental to the ability to design high-quality radiation sources. At the core of all such sources is a tradeoff between compactness and higher output radiation intensities. Conventional photonic devices are limited in size by their operating wavelength, which helps compactness at the cost of a small interaction area. Here, plasmonic modes supported by multilayer graphene metamaterials are shown to provide a larger interaction area with the electron beam, while also tapping into the extreme confinement of graphene plasmons to generate high-frequency photons with relatively low-energy electrons available from tabletop sources. For 5 MeV electrons, a metamaterial of 50 layers and length 50 µm, and a beam current of 1.7 µA, it is, for instance, possible to generate X-rays of intensity 1.5 ? 107 photons sr?1 s?1 1\%BW, 580 times more than for a single-layer design. The frequency of the driving laser dynamically tunes the photon emission spectrum. This work demonstrates a unique free-electron light source, wherein the electron mean free path in a given material is longer than the device length, relaxing the requirements of complex electron beam systems and potentially paving the way to high-yield, compact, and tunable X-ray sources.},

	abstract = {Currently hard coherent x-ray radiation at high photon fluxes can only be produced with large and expensive radiation sources, such as 3 generation synchrotrons. Especially in medicine, this limitation prevents various promising developments in imaging and therapy from being translated into clinical practice. Here we present a new concept of highly brilliant x-ray sources, line focus x-ray tubes (LFXTs), which may serve as a powerful and cheap alternative to synchrotrons and a range of other existing technologies. LFXTs employ an extremely thin focal spot and a rapidly rotating target for the electron beam which causes a change in the physical mechanism of target heating, allowing higher electron beam intensities at the focal spot. Monte Carlo simulations and numeric solutions of the heat equation are used to predict the characteristics of the LFXT. In terms of photon flux and coherence length, the performance of the line focus x-ray tube compares with inverse Compton scattering sources. Dose rates of up to 180 Gy can be reached in 50 cm distance from the focal spot. The results demonstrate that the line focus tube can serve as a powerful compact source for phase contrast imaging and microbeam radiation therapy. The production of a prototype seems technically feasible.},

Then we use the developed theory to analyze the modes with real and complex wave number in a 3D periodic lattice of lead telluride (PbTe) microspheres at infrared frequencies and in a 3D periodic lattice of titanium dioxide (TiO2) microspheres at millimeter waves. Each microsphere is equivalently modeled with both an electric and a magnetic dipole, via a method here called the dual dipole approximation (DDA). The 3D lattices exhibit first a magnetic-induced then an electric-induced feature determined by microsphere magnetic and electric resonances. The DDA wave number results are compared to the ones computed with single electric or single magnetic dipole approximation and to the ones retrieved by using the Nicolson-Ross-Weir (NRW) retrieval method from reflection and transmission of finite thickness slabs computed by a full-wave simulation. It is shown that the DDA method is in very good agreement with NRW, in contrast to the previously reported single dipole approximation methods that fail to predict one of the two features (either electric or magnetic). A mode with transverse polarization is found to be dominant and able to propagate inside the lattice, and therefore the composite material can be treated as a homogeneous one with effective refractive index. This is obtained by adopting five different retrieval procedures for each lattice, and their agreement or disagreement is discussed.},

	doi = {10.1073/pnas.1720776115},
	abstract = {The emergence of “negative” frequencies in physical systems is often accompanied by intriguing consequences. For example, supersonic motion between a source and an observer leads to a negative Doppler-shifted frequency, the physical meaning of which is time reversal of the received signal. To our knowledge, the rotational analogue of this situation—the consequences of generating negative rotationally Doppler-shifted waves—has not been studied. Here we show, using an acoustic source, that a negative rotational Doppler shift is associated with a handedness reversal of the orbital angular momentum carried by the wave. We demonstrate that this handedness reversal can occur even at significantly subsonic velocities, making our findings relevant to interactions of ultrafast rotating systems with optical frequency radiation.The linear Doppler shift is familiar as the rise and fall in pitch of a siren as it passes by. Less well known is the rotational Doppler shift, proportional to the rotation rate between source and receiver, multiplied by the angular momentum carried by the beam. In extreme cases the Doppler shift can be larger than the rest-frame frequency and for a red shift, the observed frequency then becomes “negative.” In the linear case, this effect is associated with the time reversal of the received signal, but it can be observed only with supersonic relative motion between the source and receiver. However, the rotational case is different; if the radius of rotation is smaller than the wavelength, then the velocities required to observe negative frequencies are subsonic. Using an acoustic source at ≈100 Hz we create a rotational Doppler shift larger than the laboratory-frame frequency. We observe that once the red-shifted wave passes into the “negative frequency” regime, the angular momentum associated with the sound is reversed in sign compared with that of the laboratory frame. These low-velocity laboratory realizations of extreme Doppler shifts have relevance to superoscillatory fields and offer unique opportunities to probe interactions with rotating bodies and aspects of pseudorelativistic frame translation.},

Since then, optical vortices have been widely studied, inspired by the hydrodynamics sharing similar mathematics. Akin to a fluid vortex with a central flow singularity, an optical vortex beam has a phase singularity with a certain topological charge, giving rise to a hollow intensity distribution. Such a beam with helical phase fronts and orbital angular momentum reveals a subtle connection between macroscopic physical optics and microscopic quantum optics. These amazing properties provide a new understanding of a wide range of optical and physical phenomena, including twisting photons, spin–orbital interactions, Bose–Einstein condensates, etc., while the associated technologies for manipulating optical vortices have become increasingly tunable and flexible. Hitherto, owing to these salient properties and optical manipulation technologies, tunable vortex beams have engendered tremendous advanced applications such as optical tweezers, high-order quantum entanglement, and nonlinear optics. This article reviews the recent progress in tunable vortex technologies along with their advanced applications.},

	abstract = {We perform fully relativistic calculations of the energy loss channels for a charged particle traversing a single layer of graphene under oblique incidence in a setting pertinent to a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM), where we distinguish between the energy deposited in graphene in the form of electronic excitations (Ohmic loss) and the energy emitted in the far field in the form of transition radiation (TR). Our formulation of the problem uses a definition of two in-plane, dielectric functions of graphene, which describe the longitudinal and transverse excitation processes that contribute separately to those two energy loss channels. Using several models for the electric conductivity of graphene as the input in those dielectric functions enables us to discuss the effects of oblique incidence on several processes in a broad range of frequencies, from the terahertz (THz) to the ultraviolet (UV). In particular, at the THz frequencies, we demonstrate that the nonlocal effect in the graphene's conductivity is not important in the retarded regime, and we show that the longitudinal and transverse contributions to the emitted TR spectra exhibit strongly anisotropic angular patterns that are readily distinguishable in a cathodoluminescence measurement in a STEM. Moreover, we explore the possibility of exciting the so-called transverse mode in the optical response of graphene at the mid-infrared (MIR) range of frequencies by means of a fast charged particle under oblique incidence. Finally, we demonstrate that, aside from the usual high-energy peaks in the longitudinal contribution to the Ohmic energy loss in the MIR to the UV frequency range, there may arise strongly directional features in the in-plane distribution of the transverse contribution to the Ohmic energy loss for an oblique trajectory, which could be possibly observed via momentum- and angle-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy of graphene in STEM.},

In this paper, we address one of the key limitations of the system, which IS data acquisition time. Since phase stepping algorithm requires 3 (for 120 degrees step) to 4 (for 90 degrees step) phases in order to obtain a relative phase value between the reference beam and the signal beam; therefore the phase pattern on the SLM needs to be frequently updated and the liquid crystal takes time to response; this slowsdown the data accusation process. Moreover acquiring the phase steps at different times increases microphonic noise and introduces artefacts into real time experiments, such as protein binding. In this paper, we show that a simple and innovative method to overcome these issues is to employ a vortex reference beam provided by 0 to 2π rad topological phase pattern on the SLM; this enables us to obtain multiple phase information in one single shot measurement without updating the SLM pattern.},

We also examine emerging epitaxial growth techniques that involve two-dimensional materials as an epitaxial release layer and explore future integrated computing systems that could harness both advanced epitaxial growth and lift-off approaches.},

	abstract = {The highly engineerable scattering properties of resonant optical antennas underpin the operation of metasurface-based flat optics. Thus far, the choice of antenna has been limited to shaped metallic and high-index semiconductor nanostructures that support geometrical plasmonic or Mie resonances. Whereas these resonant elements offer strong light–matter interaction and excellent control over the scattering phase and amplitude, their electrical tunability has proven to be quite limited. Here, we demonstrate how excitonic resonances in atomically thin semiconductors can be harnessed as a different, third type of resonance to create mutable, flat optics. These strong materials-based resonances are unmatched in their tunability with various external stimuli. To illustrate the concept, we first demonstrate how excitons can enhance the focusing efficiency of a millimetre-scale, patterned WS2 zone plate lens. We also show how electrical gating can completely turn on and off the exciton resonance and thereby modulate the focusing efficiency by 33\%.},

So far, studies of the interactions of cavity-confined light with quantum matter have focused on bound electron systems, such as atoms, quantum dots and quantum circuits, which are considerably limited by their fixed energy states, spectral range and selection rules. By contrast, quantum free-electron wavepackets have no such limits, but so far no experiment has shown the influence of a photonic cavity on quantum free-electron wavepackets. Here we develop a platform for multidimensional nanoscale imaging and spectroscopy of free-electron interactions with photonic cavities. We directly measure the cavity-photon lifetime via a coherent free-electron probe and observe an enhancement of more than an order of magnitude in the interaction strength relative to previous experiments of electron–photon interactions. Our free-electron probe resolves the spatiotemporal and energy–momentum information of the interaction. The quantum nature of the electrons is verified by spatially mapping Rabi oscillations of the electron spectrum. The interactions between free electrons and cavity photons could enable low-dose, ultrafast electron microscopy of soft matter or other beam-sensitive materials. Such interactions may also open paths towards using free electrons for quantum information processing and quantum sensing. Future studies could achieve free-electron strong coupling6,7, photon quantum state synthesis8 and quantum nonlinear phenomena such as cavity electro-optomechanics9.},

Sensitive imaging of gamma rays is widely used; however, radioactive decay is a physical constant, and its signal is independent of biological interactions. Here, we introduce a framework of previously uncharacterized targeted and activatable probes that are excited by a nuclear decay-derived signal to identify and measure molecular signatures of disease. We accomplished this by using Cerenkov luminescence, the light produced by β-particle-emitting radionuclides such as clinical positron emission tomography (PET) tracers. Disease markers were detected using nanoparticles to produce secondary Cerenkov-induced fluorescence. This approach reduces background signal compared to conventional fluorescence imaging. In addition to tumor identification from a conventional PET scan, we demonstrate the medical utility of our approach by quantitatively determining prognostically relevant enzymatic activity. This technique can be applied to monitor other markers and represents a shift toward activatable nuclear medicine agents. © 2013 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The development of novel multimodality imaging agents and techniques represents the current frontier of research in the field of medical imaging science. However, the combination of nuclear tomography with optical techniques has yet to be established. Here, we report the use of the inherent optical emissions from the decay of radiopharmaceuticals for Cerenkov luminescence imaging (CLI) of tumors in vivo and correlate the results with those obtained from concordant immuno-PET studies. Methods: In vitro phantom studies were used to validate the visible light emission observed from a range of radionuclides including the positron emitters18F,64Cu,89Zr, and124I; b-emitter131I; and α-particle emitter 225Ac for potential use in CLI. The novel radiolabeled monoclonal antibody89Zr-desferrioxamine B [DFO]-J591 for immuno-PET of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) expression was used to coregister and correlate the CLI signal observed with the immuno-PET images and biodistribution studies. Results: Phantom studies confirmed that Cerenkov radiation can be observed from a range of positron-, β-, and α-emitting radionuclides using standard optical imaging devices. The change in light emission intensity versus time was concordant with radionuclide decay and was also found to correlate linearly with both the activity concentration and the measured PET signal (percentage injected dose per gram). In vivo studies conducted in male severe combined immune deficient mice bearing PSMA-positive, subcutaneous LNCaP tumors demonstrated that tumor-specific uptake of89Zr-DFO-J591 could be visualized by both immuno-PET and CLI. Optical and immuno-PET signal intensities were found to increase over time from 24 to 96 h, and biodistribution studies were found to correlate well with both imaging modalities. Conclusion: These studies represent the first, to our knowledge, quantitative assessment of CLI for measuring radiotracer uptake in vivo. Many radionuclides common to both nuclear tomographic imaging and radiotherapy have the potential to be used in CLI. The value of CLI lies in its ability to image radionuclides that do not emit either positrons or γ-rays and are, thus, unsuitable for use with current nuclear imaging modalities. Optical imaging of Cerenkov radiation emission shows excellent promise as a potential new imaging modality for the rapid, high-throughput screening of radiopharmaceuticals.

Confinement of the accelerating fields is achieved, for both planar and cylindrical configurations by adjusting the first dielectric layer width. A typical structure made of silica and zirconia may support gradients of the order of [Formula presented] with an interaction impedance of a few hundreds of ohms and with an energy velocity of less than [Formula presented]. An interaction impedance of about [Formula presented] may be obtained by replacing the Zirconia with a (fictitious) material of [Formula presented]. Special attention is paid to the wake field developing in such a structure. In the case of a relatively small number of layers, it is shown that the total electromagnetic power emitted is proportional to the square of the number of electrons in the macrobunch and inversely proportional to the number of microbunches; this power is also inversely proportional to the square of the internal radius of the structure for a cylindrical structure, and to the width of the vacuum core in a planar structure. Quantitative results are given for a higher number of dielectric layers, showing that in comparison to a structure bounded by metallic walls, the emitted power is significantly smaller due to propagation bands allowing electromagnetic energy to escape. © 2004 The American Physical Society.},

The gain is found to be inversely proportional to the wavelength, suggesting the possibility of a vacuum ultraviolet or soft X-ray laser. The randomization of the phase coherence between the wave and the electrons due to multiple scattering of the electrons by the atoms of the dielectric is minimized by limiting the length of interaction, and increasing the electron beam energy. Early unpublished experiments are given in which quartz resonators were placed in the Mark III Linear Accelerator's electron beam at Stanford University.

	abstract = {Interest in the development of laser-driven linacs has been stimu-lated recently by the advent of the high-power lasers. The use of a laser to accelerate charged particles was first proposed by K. Shimoda in 1962 1. He noticed that high values of acceleration per metre (acceleration gradient) could be obtained with an intense electric field in the output of a high-power laser. The inverse Smith-Purcell (ISP) effect proposed by us2 is a candidate for laser-driven linacs with a metallic grating as an interaction circuit. In 1953 Smith and Purcell demonstrated that light is emitted when a high-voltage electron beam moves parallel and close to a metallic optical diffraction grating in a direction perpendicular to the grating rulings3. The dispersion relationship is a synchronous condition between the electrons and the wave on the grating. Therefore, the inverse Smith-Purcell effect (ISP), or the extended interaction between electrons and an incident light wave should occur when the same relation is satisfied between the electrons and the incident wave (Fig. 1)2. Lawson pointed out4 that this effect would fail to accelerate relativistic particles. This difficulty was solved by Palmer5, who showed that acceleration is possible either if the particles travel skew to the grating lines, or if the radiation is falling at a skew angle onto the grating. Several authors have described possibilities for producing a grating linac (ISP effect) with accelerating field of a few GeV m-1 in the infrared or optical wave region6. Here we report the first observational evidence for this effect using a submillimetre-wave laser as a driving source. The experimental results give good agreement with theoretical predictions. © 1987 Nature Publishing Group.},

Calculations are offered for a charge moving near both planar and nonplanar surfaces. CR is found to be produced even when the external charge moves outside a semi-infinite medium. For charges moving near planar boundaries, the reflected radiation interferes with the direct CR, leading to oscillations in the emission probability as a function of the impact parameter relative to the interfaces. Thin-film guided modes are excited by penetrating electrons and our calculations agree reasonably well with available experiments. The bulk limit in the emission probability is recovered for charges passing by the center of cylinders or spheres of increasingly large radius. Recent experiments of energy loss of electrons passing near dielectric spheres are explained thanks to the inclusion of retardation effects in the sphere response. These effects lead to an efficient channel of radiative energy losses. Finally, the diffraction of CR in void inclusions is proposed as a tool for providing information on otherwise inaccessible buried structures.},

The running wave of polarization travels with a speed determined by the angle of incidence and the photon spin angular momentum of the incident radiation. By changing either one of these properties we demonstrate controlled steering of the Cherenkov surface plasmon wakes.},

A ±13\% variation about the pressure for optimum energy exchange reduced the interaction by one-half. The results of the experiment agree with the predictions of a Monte Carlo computer simulation of the interaction. Methane gas was also investigated as a phase-matching medium.

	abstract = {The fundamental coherent radiation emission processes from a bunched charged particles beam are outlined. In contrast to spontaneous emission of radiation from a random electron beam that is proportional to the number of particles, a prebunched electron beam can emit spontaneously coherent radiation proportional to the number of particles - squared, through the process of (spontaneous) superradiance (SP-SR) (in the sense of Dicke's). The coherent SP-SR emission of a bunched electron beam can be even further enhanced by a process of stimulated superradiance in the presence of a seed-injected radiation field. In this review, these coherent radiation emission processes for both single bunch and periodically bunched beams are considered in a model of radiation mode expansion. The general model of coherent spontaneous emission is extended to the nonlinear regime, particularly for undulator (wiggler) interaction: tapering-enhanced stimulated-superradiant amplification (TESSA). Processes of SP-SR and TESSA take place in tapered wiggler seed-injected free-electron lasers (FELs). In such FELs, operating in the x-ray regime, these processes are convoluted with other effects. However these fundamental emission concepts are useful guidelines for the strategy of wiggler tapering efficiency and power enhancement. Based on this model, previous theories and experiments are reviewed on coherent radiation sources based on SP-SR (coherent undulator radiation, synchrotron radiation, Smith-Purcell radiation, etc.), in the THz regime and on-going works on tapered wiggler efficiency-enhancement concepts in all optical frequency regimes up to x rays.},

In this Review, we highlight recent developments and inventions made by introducing the fourth dimension of time in electron microscopy. Today, ultrafast electron microscopy (4D UEM) enables a resolution that is 10 orders of magnitude better than that of conventional microscopes, which are limited by the video-camera rate of recording. After presenting the central concept involved, that of single-electron stroboscopic imaging, we discuss prototypical applications, which include the visualization of complex structures when unfolding on different length and time scales. The developed UEM variant techniques are several, and here we illucidate convergent-beam and near-field imaging, as well as tomography and scanning-pulse microscopy.

The corresponding accelerating field enhancement represents a potential reduction in active length of the accelerator between 1 and 2 orders of magnitude. Power sources for DLA-based accelerators (lasers) are less costly than microwave sources (klystrons) for equivalent average power levels due to wider availability and private sector investment. Because of the high laser-to-particle coupling efficiency, required pulse energies are consistent with tabletop microJoule class lasers.

	abstract = {The enormous size and cost of current state-of-the-art accelerators based on conventional radio-frequency technology has spawned great interest in the development of new acceleration concepts that are more compact and economical. Micro-fabricated dielectric laser accelerators (DLAs) are an attractive approach, because such dielectric microstructures can support accelerating fields one to two orders of magnitude higher than can radio-frequency cavity-based accelerators. DLAs use commercial lasers as a power source, which are smaller and less expensive than the radio-frequency klystrons that power today's accelerators. In addition, DLAs are fabricated via low-cost, lithographic techniques that can be used for mass production. However, despite several DLA structures having been proposed recently, no successful demonstration of acceleration in these structures has so far been shown. Here we report high-gradient (beyond 250 MeV m-1) acceleration of electrons in a DLA. Relativistic (60-MeV) electrons are energy-modulated over 563 ± 104 optical periods of a fused silica grating structure, powered by a 800-nm-wavelength mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser. The observed results are in agreement with analytical models and electrodynamic simulations. By comparison, conventional modern linear accelerators operate at gradients of 10-30 MeV m -1, and the first linear radio-frequency cavity accelerator was ten radio-frequency periods (one metre) long with a gradient of approximately 1.6 MeV m-1 (ref. 5). Our results set the stage for the development of future multi-staged DLA devices composed of integrated on-chip systems. This would enable compact table-top accelerators on the MeV-GeV (10 6-10 9 eV) scale for security scanners and medical therapy, university-scale X-ray light sources for biological and materials research, and portable medical imaging devices, and would substantially reduce the size and cost of a future collider on the multi-TeV (10 12 eV) scale. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

	abstract = {The vanishingly small response of matter to light above ultraviolet frequencies makes the manipulation of light emission at such frequencies challenging. As a result, state-of-the-art sources of high-frequency light are typically active, relying on strong external electromagnetic fields. Here, we present a fundamental mechanism of light emission that is fully passive, relying instead on vacuum fluctuations near nanophotonic structures. This mechanism can be used to generate light at any frequency, including high-frequency radiation such as X-rays. The proposed mechanism is equivalent to a quantum optical two-photon process, in which a free electron spontaneously emits a low-energy polariton and a high-energy photon simultaneously. Although two-photon processes are nominally weak, we find that the resulting X-ray radiation can be substantial. The strength of this process is related to the strong Casimir–Polder forces that atoms experience in the nanometre vicinity of materials, with the essential difference being that the fluctuating force here acts on a free electron, rather than a neutral, polarizable atom. The light emission can be shaped by controlling the nanophotonic geometry or the underlying material electromagnetic response at optical or infrared frequencies. Our results reveal ways of applying the tools of nanophotonics even at frequencies where materials have an insubstantial electromagnetic response. The process we study, when scaled up, may also enable new concepts for compact and tunable X-ray radiation.},

	abstract = {Investigating the interaction of electron beams with materials and light has been a field of research for more than a century. The field was advanced theoretically by the rise of quantum mechanics and technically by the introduction of electron microscopes and accelerators. It is possible nowadays to uncover a multitude of information from electron-induced excitations in matter by means of advanced techniques like holography, tomography, and, most recently, photon-induced near-field electron microscopy. The question is whether the interaction can be controlled in an even, more efficient way in order to unravel important questions like modal decomposition of the electron-induced polarization by performing experiments with better spatial, temporal, and energy resolutions. This review discusses recent advances in controlling electron and light interactions at the nanoscale. Theoretical and numerical aspects of the interaction of electrons with nanostructures and metamaterials will be discussed with the aim of understanding the mechanisms of radiation in the interaction of electrons with even more sophisticated structures. Based on these mechanisms of radiation, state-of-the art and novel electron-driven few-photon sources will be discussed. Applications of such sources to gain an understanding of quantum optical effects and also to perform spectral interferometry with electron microscopes will be covered. In an inverse approach, as in the case of the inverse Smith-Purcell effect, laser-induced excitations of nanostructures can cause electron beams traveling in the near-field of such structures to accelerate, provided a synchronization criterion is satisfied. This effect is the basis for linear dielectric and metallic electron accelerators. Moreover, acceleration is accompanied by bunching of the electrons. When single electrons are considered, an efficient design of nanostructures can lead to the shaping of the electron wave function travelling adjacent to them, for example to form attosecond electron pulses or chiral electron wave functions.},

The electrons undergo energy losses and gains (also giving rise to cathodoluminescence light emission), which are recorded to reveal the optical landscape along the beam path.

As a consequence, they can be also better manipulated into the desired shape. For example, they get bunched quite fast in interaction with acceleration gratings in presence of an external electromagnetic radiation, a phenomenon which can be desirable in development of superradiant coherent light sources. Here, I examine the spatiotemporal behavior of pulsed electron wave packets at low energies interacting with pulsed light and optical gratings, using a quantum-mechanical self-consistent numerical toolbox which is introduced here. It will be shown that electron pulses are accelerated very fast in interaction with the near-field of the grating, demanding that a synchronicity condition is met. To prevent the electrons to be transversely deflected from the grating a symmetric double-grating configuration is necessary. It is found that even in this configuration, diffraction due to the interaction of the electron with the standing-wave light inside the gap between the gratings, is a source of defocusing. Moreover, the longitudinal broadening of the electron pulse directly affects the final shape of the electron wave packet due to the occurrence of multiple electron-photon scatterings. These investigations pave the way towards the design of more efficient electron-driven photon sources and accelerators.},

The characteristics of the radiative interaction when the wavepacket size (duration) is short relative to the radiation wavelength, are close to the predictions of the classical point-particle modelling. On the other hand, in the long-sized wavepacket limit, the interaction is quantum-mechanical, and it diminishes exponentially at high frequency. We exemplify these effects through the scheme of Smith-Purcell radiation, and demonstrate that if the wavepacket is optically-modulated and periodically-bunched, it exhibits finite radiative emission at harmonics of the modulation frequency beyond the limit of high-frequency cutoff. Besides, the radiation analysis is further extended to the cases of superradiant emission from a beam of phase-correlated modulated electron wavepackets. The features of the wavepacket-dependent radiative emission explain the classical-to-quantum transition, and indicate a way for measuring the quantum electron wavepacket size. This suggests a new direction for exploring light–matter interaction.},

Unlike conventional holography, where signal and reference are spatially separated and then recombined to interfere, our method relies on electromagnetic fields to split an electron wave function in a quantum coherent superposition of different energy states.

	abstract = {We report on a novel way of performing stimulated electron energy-loss and energy-gain spectroscopy (sEELS/sEEGS) experiments that does not require a pulsed gun. In this scheme, a regular scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) equipped with a conventional continuous electron gun is fitted with a modified EELS detector and a light injector in the object chamber. The modification of the EELS detector allows one to expose the EELS camera during tunable time intervals that can be synchronized with nanosecond laser pulses hitting the sample, therefore allowing us to collect only those electrons that have interacted with the sample under light irradiation. Using ∼ 5 ns laser pulses of ∼ 2 eV photon energy on various plasmonic silver samples, we obtain evidence of sEELS/sEEGS through the emergence of up to two loss and gain peaks in the spectra at ± 2 and ± 4 eV. Because this approach does not involve any modification of the gun, our method retains the original performances of the microscope in terms of energy resolution and spectral imaging with and without light injection. Compared to pulsed-gun techniques, our method is mainly limited to a perturbative regime (typically no more that one gain event per incident electron), which allows us to observe resonant effects, in particular when the plasmon energy of a silver nanostructure matches the laser photon energy. In this situation, EELS and EEGS signals are enhanced in proportion to n+1 and n, respectively, where n is the average plasmon population due to the external illumination. The n term is associated with stimulated loss and gain processes, and the term of 1 corresponds to conventional (spontaneous) loss. The EELS part of the spectrum is therefore an incoherent superposition of spontaneous and stimulated EEL events. This is confirmed by a proper quantum-mechanical description of the electron/light/plasmon system incorporating light–plasmon and plasmon–electron interactions, as well as inelastic plasmon decay.},

In a comparison with excitation by green (519-nm) pulses, similar first-order PINEM peak amplitudes were obtained for optical fluence differing by a factor of more than 60 at the interface of copper metal and vacuum. Under high fluence, the nonlinear regime of IR PINEM was observed, and its spatial dependence was studied.

The subsequent dispersive propagation leads to a compression of the electrons and the formation of ultrashort pulses.

However, electron beams typically couple only weakly to optical excitations, and emerging applications in electron control and sensing8–11 require large enhancements using tailored fields and interactions. Here we couple a free-electron beam to a travelling-wave resonant cavity mode. The enhanced interaction with the optical whispering-gallery modes of dielectric microresonators induces a strong phase modulation on co-propagating electrons, which leads to a spectral broadening of 700 electronvolts, corresponding to the absorption and emission of hundreds of photons. By mapping the near-field interaction with ultrashort electron pulses in space and time, we trace the lifetime of the the microresonator following a femtosecond excitation and observe the spectral response of the cavity.

Examples of such studies include observation of anomalous quantum Hall effect in monolayer graphene, demonstration of topological zero modes in “molecular graphene” assembled by scanning tunneling microscopy, and detection of topological valley transport either in graphene superlattices or at bilayer graphene domain walls. However, all aforementioned experiments involved nonscalable approaches of either mechanically exfoliated flakes or atom-by-atom constructions. Here, we report an approach to manipulating the topological states in monolayer graphene via nanoscale strain engineering at room temperature. By placing strain-free monolayer graphene on architected nanostructures to induce global inversion symmetry breaking, we demonstrate the development of giant pseudo-magnetic fields (up to {\textasciitilde}800 T), valley polarization, and periodic one-dimensional topological channels for protected propagation of chiral modes in strained graphene, thus paving a pathway toward scalable graphene-based valleytronics.},

The interplay of structural and electronic properties is successfully described by the modelling of curvature and elastic deformations by fictitious gauge fields. These fields have become an experimental reality after the observation of the Landau levels that can form in graphene due to strain. Here we propose a device to detect microstresses in graphene based on a scanning-tunnelling-microscopy set-up able to measure Aharonov-Bohm interferences at the nanometre scale.

	abstract = {Among many remarkable qualities of graphene, its electronic properties attract particular interest owing to the chiral character of the charge carriers, which leads to such unusual phenomena as metallic conductivity in the limit of no carriers and the half-integer quantum Hall effect observable even at room temperature. Because graphene is only one atom thick, it is also amenable to external influences, including mechanical deformation. The latter offers a tempting prospect of controlling graphenes properties by strain and, recently, several reports have examined graphene under uniaxial deformation. Although the strain can induce additional Raman features, no significant changes in graphenes band structure have been either observed or expected for realistic strains of up to ∼15\% (refs9, 10, 11). Here we show that a designed strain aligned along three main crystallographic directions induces strong gauge fields that effectively act as a uniform magnetic field exceeding 10 T. For a finite doping, the quantizing field results in an insulating bulk and a pair of countercirculating edge states, similar to the case of a topological insulator. We suggest realistic ways of creating this quantum state and observing the pseudomagnetic quantum Hall effect. We also show that strained superlattices can be used to open significant energy gaps in graphenes electronic spectrum. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

An obvious photoluminescence is demonstrated in NSs and the self-encapsulated structure makes NSs more insensitive to external factors in optical and electrical properties.

For paper analogues, a critical difference between macroscopic sheets and a two-dimensional solid is the molecular scale of the thin dimension of the latter, allowing the thermal activation of considerable out-of-plane motion. So far thermal activity has been shown to produce local wrinkles in a free graphene sheet that help in theoretically understanding its stability, for example, and give rise to unexpected long-range bending stiffness. Here we show that thermal activation can have a more marked effect on the behaviour of two-dimensional solids, leading to spontaneous and self-driven sliding, tearing and peeling from a substrate on scales approaching the macroscopic. We demonstrate that scalable nanoimprint-style contact techniques can nucleate and direct the parallel self-assembly of graphene ribbons of controlled shape in ambient conditions. We interpret our observations through a simple fracture-mechanics model that shows how thermodynamic forces drive the formation of the graphene-graphene interface in lieu of substrate contact with sufficient strength to peel and tear multilayer graphene sheets. Our results show how weak physical surface forces can be harnessed and focused by simple folded configurations of graphene to tear the strongest covalent bond. This effect may hold promise for the patterning and mechanical actuating of devices based on two-dimensional materials.},

In many cases, monolayer or few-layer 2D crystals are transferred to a target substrate including other 2D crystals, and nanometer-scale blisters form spontaneously between the 2D crystal and its substrate. Such nanoblisters are often recognized as an indicator of good adhesion, but there is no consensus on the contents inside the blisters. While gas-filled blisters have been modeled and measured by bulge tests, applying such models to spontaneously formed nanoblisters yielded unrealistically low adhesion energy values between the 2D crystal and its substrate. Typically, gas-filled blisters are fully deflated within hours or days. In contrast, we found that the height of the spontaneously formed nanoblisters dropped only by 20–30\% after 3 mo, indicating that probably liquid instead of gas is trapped in them. We therefore developed a simple scaling law and a rigorous theoretical model for liquid-filled nanoblisters, which predicts that the interfacial work of adhesion is related to the fourth power of the aspect ratio of the nanoblister and depends on the surface tension of the liquid. Our model was verified by molecular dynamics simulations, and the adhesion energy values obtained for the measured nanoblisters are in good agreement with those reported in the literature. This model can be applied to estimate the pressure inside the nanoblisters and the work of adhesion for a variety of 2D interfaces, which provides important implications for the fabrication and deformability of 2D heterostructures and devices.},

Graphene is attractive for nanomechanical systems1,2 because its Young's modulus and strength are both intrinsically high, but the mechanical behaviour of graphene is also strongly influenced by the van der Waals force3,4. For example, this force clamps graphene samples to substrates, and also holds together the individual graphene sheets in multilayer samples.

We find an adhesion energy of 0.45±0.02Jm-2 for monolayer graphene and 0.31±0.03Jm-2 for samples containing two to five graphene sheets. These values are larger than the adhesion energies measured in typical micromechanical structures and are comparable to solid-liquid adhesion energies5-7.

Using atomic force microscopy, we analysed a variety of bubbles formed by monolayers of graphene, boron nitride and MoS 2. Their shapes are found to exhibit universal scaling, in agreement with our analysis based on the theory of elasticity of membranes. We also measured the hydrostatic pressure induced by the confinement, which was found to reach tens of MPa inside submicron bubbles.

This, in return, presents a unique technique for tuning their physical properties by "strain engineering". Here, we find that local strain induced on ReSe2, a new member of the transition metal dichalcogenides family, greatly changes its magnetic, optical, and electrical properties. Local strain induced by generation of wrinkle (1) modulates the optical gap as evidenced by red-shifted photoluminescence peak, (2) enhances light emission, (3) induces magnetism, and (4) modulates the electrical properties.

However, deterministic measure and control of strain fields in these systems are challenging because of the atomic thinness and unconventional interface behaviors of 2D materials. Here, we experimentally characterize a simple and unified power law for the profiles of a variety of nanobubbles and nanotents formed by 2D materials such as graphene and MoS2 layers. Using membrane theory, we analytically unveil what sets the in-plane strains of these blisters regarding their shape and interface characteristics. Our analytical solutions are validated by Raman spectroscopy measured strain distributions in bulged graphene bubbles supported by strong and weak shear interfaces. We advocate that both the strain magnitudes and distributions can be tuned by 2D material-substrate interface adhesion and friction properties.},

With increasing pillar density, ripples in collapsed films display a transition from random oriented pleats emerging from pillars to organized domains of parallel ripples linking pillars, eventually leading to suspended tent-like features. Spatially resolved Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and electronic microscopy reveal uniaxial strain domains in the transferred graphene, which are induced and controlled by the geometry. We propose a simple theoretical model to explain the structural transition between fully suspended and collapsed graphene. For the arrays of high density pillars, graphene membranes stay suspended over macroscopic distances with minimal interaction with the pillars apexes. It offers a platform to tailor stress in graphene layers and opens perspectives for electron transport and nanomechanical applications.},

Here, we introduce a self-bending point spread function (SB-PSF) based on Airy beams for three-dimensional super-resolution fluorescence imaging.

The lack of diffraction and the propagation-dependent lateral bending make the SB-PSF well suited for precise three-dimensional localization of molecules over a large imaging depth. Using this method, we obtained super-resolution imaging with isotropic three-dimensional localization precision of 10-15 nm over a 3 μm imaging depth from ∼2,000 photons per localization. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

We prove that, if all inelastically scattered electrons are collected, then the fraction of electrons that will be determined to have given rise to excitation in a localized target at impact parameter b may be calculated by simply convoluting over b (1) the probability Pc(b) that a classical electron with the same velocity well create the excitation at given b, with (2) the probability of finding the electron in the microprobe at that impact parameter. We also show that, even in the opposite extreme, when a small solid angle of axial collection is employed, the energy-loss spectrum will still approximate to the classical expression provided that it is normalized to the same zero-loss intensity and if the Fourier-transformed profile function does not become too small for some ranges of its argument. A realistic microprobe distribution is used to compute the angular distribution of electrons that have created a surface plasmon or a surface optical phonon at a surface parallel to the electron trajectory.

By contrast, quantum interactions of free electrons with light have only become accessible in recent years, following the discovery of photon-induced near-field electron microscopy (PINEM). So far, the fundamental free electron–light interaction in all PINEM experiments has remained weak due to its localized near-field nature, which imposes an energy–momentum mismatch between electrons and light. Here, we demonstrate a strong interaction between free-electron waves and light waves, resulting from precise energy–momentum phase-matching with the extended propagating light field. By exchanging hundreds of photons with the field, each electron simultaneously accelerates and decelerates in a coherent manner. Consequently, each electron’s quantum wavefunction evolves into a quantized energy comb, spanning a bandwidth of over 1,700 eV, requiring us to extend the PINEM theory. Our observation of coherent electron phase-matching with a propagating wave is a type of inverse-Cherenkov interaction that occurs with a quantum electron wavefunction, demonstrating how the extended nature of the electron wavefunction can alter stimulated electron–light interactions.},

	abstract = {Fundamental quantum electrodynamical (QED) processes, such as spontaneous emission and electron-photon scattering, encompass phenomena that underlie much of modern science and technology. Conventionally, calculations in QED and other field theories treat incoming particles as single-momentum states, omitting the possibility that coherent superposition states, i.e., shaped wavepackets, can alter fundamental scattering processes. Here, we show that free electron waveshaping can be used to design interferences between two or more pathways in a QED process, enabling precise control over the rate of that process. As an example, we show that free electron waveshaping modifies both spatial and spectral characteristics of bremsstrahlung emission, leading for instance to enhancements in directionality and monochromaticity. The ability to tailor general QED processes opens up additional avenues of control in phenomena ranging from optical excitation (e.g., plasmon and phonon emission) in electron microscopy to free electron lasing in the quantum regime.},

	abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) and graphene compose a new family of crystalline materials with atomic thicknesses and exotic mechanical, electronic, and optical properties. Due to their inherent exceptional mechanical flexibility and strength, these 2D materials provide an ideal platform for strain engineering, enabling versatile modulation and significant enhancement of their optical properties. For instance, recent theoretical and experimental investigations have demonstrated flexible control over their electronic states via application of external strains, such as uniaxial strain and biaxial strain. Meanwhile, many nondestructive optical measurement methods, typically including absorption, reflectance, photoluminescence, and Raman spectroscopies, can be readily exploited to quantitatively determine strain-engineered optical properties. This review begins with an introduction to the macroscopic theory of crystal elasticity and microscopic effective low-energy Hamiltonians coupled with strain fields, and then summarizes recent advances in strain-induced optical responses of 2D TMDCs and graphene, followed by the strain engineering techniques. It concludes with exciting applications associated with strained 2D materials, discussions on existing open questions, and an outlook on this intriguing emerging field.},

However, recent advances triggered fundamental questions regarding the role of the particle wave function in these processes. Here, we find that even in seemingly classical experimental regimes, light emission is fundamentally tied to the quantum coherence and correlations of the emitting particle. We use quantum electrodynamics to show how the particle’s momentum uncertainty determines the optical coherence of the emitted light. We find that the temporal duration of Cherenkov radiation, envisioned for almost a century as a shock wave of light, is limited by underlying entanglement between the particle and light. Our findings enable new capabilities in electron microscopy for measuring quantum correlations of shaped electrons. Last, we propose new Cherenkov detection schemes, whereby measuring spectral photon autocorrelations can unveil the wave function structure of any charged high-energy particle.},

	abstract = {Many animals have evolved adept sensory systems that enable dexterous mobility in complex environments. Echolocating bats hunting in dense vegetation represent an extreme case of this, where all necessary information about the environment must pass through a parsimonious channel of pulsed, 1D echo signals. We have investigated whether certain bats (rhinolophids and hipposiderids) actively create Doppler shifts with their pinnae to encode additional sensory information. Our results show that the bats’ active pinna motions are a source of Doppler shifts that have all attributes required for a functional relevance: (i) the Doppler shifts produced were several times larger than the reported perception threshold; (ii) the motions of the fastest moving pinna portions were oriented to maximize the Doppler shifts for echoes returning from the emission direction, indicating a possible evolutionary optimization; (iii) pinna motions coincided with echo reception; (iv) Doppler-shifted signals from the fast-moving pinna portion entered the ear canal of a biomimetic pinna model; and (v) the time-frequency Doppler shift signatures were found to encode target direction in an orderly fashion. These results indicate that instead of avoiding or suppressing all self-produced Doppler shifts, rhinolophid and hipposiderid bats actively create Doppler shifts with their own pinnae. These bats could hence make use of a previously unknown nonlinear mechanism for the encoding of sensory information, based on Doppler signatures. Such a mechanism could be a source for the discovery of sensing principles not only in sensory physiology but also in the engineering of sensory systems.},

	abstract = {This chapter discusses the morphologies of caustics and their diffraction patterns. In catastrophe optics, wave motion is viewed in terms of the contrast and interplay among the morphologies of three extreme regimes. Firstly, if the wavelength λ is small in comparison with scales of variation of diffracting objects or refracting media, the wavefield is dominated by the caustics and associated diffraction patterns. Secondly, when waves propagate in environments which can be modeled by a hierarchy of scales extending to the infinitely small, caustics cannot occur and the limit λ → 0 is not geometrical optics. And thirdly, when waves are explored on the scale of λ, the principal features are wavefronts, which are dominated by their singularities in the form of lines in space. The chapter also discusses the diffraction catastrophes that both clothe and underlie caustics. Each structurally stable caustic has its characteristic diffraction pattern, whose wave function has an integral representation in terms of the standard polynomial describing the corresponding catastrophe. The diffraction catastrophes constitute a new hierarchy of functions, different from the special functions of analysis. The newest application of catastrophe optics is to random short waves, whose statistical properties are determined by the random caustic structure. © 1980, Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

These unique interfaces are typically constructed using mechanical or deposition-based methods to build a heterostructure one monolayer at a time2,3. By contrast, self-assembly is a scalable technique, where complex materials can selectively form in solution4–6. Here we show a synthetic strategy for the self-assembly of layered perovskite–non-perovskite heterostructures into large single crystals in aqueous solution. Using bifunctional organic molecules as directing groups, we have isolated six layered heterostructures that form as an interleaving of perovskite slabs with a different inorganic lattice, previously unknown to crystallize with perovskites. In many cases, these intergrown lattices are 2D congeners of canonical inorganic structure types. To our knowledge, these compounds are the first layered perovskite heterostructures formed using organic templates and characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Notably, this interleaving of inorganic structures can markedly transform the band structure. Optical data and first principles calculations show that substantive coupling between perovskite and intergrowth layers leads to new electronic transitions distributed across both sublattices. Given the technological promise of halide perovskites4, this intuitive synthetic route sets a foundation for the directed synthesis of richly structured complex semiconductors that self-assemble in water.},

However, various adsorbates become trapped between layers during their assembly, and this not only affects the resulting quality but also prevents the formation of a true artificial layered crystal upheld by van der Waals interaction, creating instead a laminate glued together by contamination. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has shown that graphene and boron nitride monolayers, the two best characterized 2D crystals, are densely covered with hydrocarbons (even after thermal annealing in high vacuum) and exhibit only small clean patches suitable for atomic resolution imaging. This observation seems detrimental for any realistic prospect of creating van der Waals materials and heterostructures with atomically sharp interfaces. Here we employ cross sectional TEM to take a side view of several grapheneg-boron nitride heterostructures. We find that the trapped hydrocarbons segregate into isolated pockets, leaving the interfaces atomically clean. Moreover, we observe a clear correlation between interface roughness and the electronic quality of encapsulated graphene.

However, the 2D vdW heterostructures explored so far have been usually limited to relatively simple heterostructures with a small number of blocks8–18. The preparation of high-order vdW superlattices with larger number of alternating units is exponentially more difficult, owing to the limited yield and material damage associated with each sequential restacking or synthesis step8–29. Here we report a straightforward approach to realizing high-order vdW superlattices by rolling up vdW heterostructures. We show that a capillary-force-driven rolling-up process can be used to delaminate synthetic SnS2/WSe2 vdW heterostructures from the growth substrate and produce SnS2/WSe2 roll-ups with alternating monolayers of WSe2 and SnS2, thus forming high-order SnS2/WSe2 vdW superlattices. The formation of these superlattices modulates the electronic band structure and the dimensionality, resulting in a transition of the transport characteristics from semiconducting to metallic, from 2D to one-dimensional (1D), with an angle-dependent linear magnetoresistance. This strategy can be extended to create diverse 2D/2D vdW superlattices, more complex 2D/2D/2D vdW superlattices, and beyond-2D materials, including three-dimensional (3D) thin-film materials and 1D nanowires, to generate mixed-dimensional vdW superlattices, such as 3D/2D, 3D/2D/2D, 1D/2D and 1D/3D/2D vdW superlattices. This study demonstrates a general approach to producing high-order vdW superlattices with widely variable material compositions, dimensions, chirality and topology, and defines a rich material platform for both fundamental studies and technological applications.},

With this approach, graphene and transition-metal dichalcogenides - which represent one- And three-atom-thick two-dimensional building blocks, respectively - have been used to realize previously inaccessible heterostructures with interesting physical properties. However, no large-scale assembly method exists at present that maintains the intrinsic properties of these two-dimensional building blocks while producing pristine interlayer interfaces, thus limiting the layer-by-layer assembly method to small-scale proof-of-concept demonstrations.

The laser threshold current density was 4 kA/cm2. The emission wavelength is the shortest one ever generated by a semiconductor laser diode.},

	abstract = {Van der Waals heterostructures with small misalignment between adjacent layers (‘interlayer twist’) are of interest because of electronic structure and correlation phenomena (such as superconductivity) that are determined by both the atomic lattice and long-range superlattice potentials arising in interlayer moiré patterns1–7. Previously, such twisted heterostructures have involved a single planar interface between layers isolated by exfoliation and micromechanically stacked in the desired relative orientation1,8–12. Here we demonstrate a class of materials—van der Waals nanowires of layered crystals—in which a tunable interlayer twist evolves naturally during synthesis. In vapour–liquid–solid growth, nanowires of germanium(ii) sulfide, an anisotropic layered semiconductor, crystallize with layering along the wire axis13 and have a strong propensity for forming axial screw dislocations. Nanometre-resolved electron diffraction shows that Eshelby twist, induced by a torque on the ends of a cylindrical solid due to the stress field of an axial dislocation14,15, causes a chiral structure in the van der Waals nanowires. The in-plane germanium sulfide crystal axes progressively rotate along the wire, and germanium sulfide layers in adjacent turns of the helix naturally form a moiré pattern because of their interlayer twist. The axial rotation and the twist are tunable by varying the nanowire thickness. Combined electron diffraction and cathodoluminescence spectroscopy show the correlation between the interlayer twist and locally excited light emission that is due to progressive changes in the lattice orientation and in the interlayer moiré registry along the nanowires. The findings demonstrate a step towards scalable fabrication of van der Waals structures with defined twist angles, in which interlayer moiré patterns are realized along a helical path on a nanowire instead of a planar interface.},

We show that this compressive response arises from a dynamic modulation of the interlayer van der Waals interaction and that this represents the dominant light-induced stress at low excitation densities. A simple analytic model predicts the magnitude and carrier density dependence of the measured strains. This work establishes a new method for dynamic, nonequilibrium tuning of correlation-driven dispersive interactions and of the optomechanical functionality of TMDC quasi-two-dimensional materials.},

The interlayer spacing of this film can be precisely adjusted, which enables a tunable porosity. By systematically tailoring the pore size for the electrolyte ions, pores are utilized optimally and thereby the volumetric capacitance is maximized. Consequently, the fabricated supercapacitor delivers a stack volumetric energy density of 88.1 Wh l−1 in an ionic liquid electrolyte, representing a critical breakthrough for optimizing the porosity towards compact energy storage.

The strong chemical interaction between active sites and Pt atoms contributes to the intercalation behavior of Pt atoms in the interlayer of 2D materials and further promotes the formation of chemical bonding between Pt atom and host materials. Taking cerium-embedded molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) as an example, intercalation of Pt atoms enables interlayer distance tuning via an electrochemical protocol, leading to interlayer spacing reversible and linear compression and expansion from 6.546 ± 0.039 Å to 5.792 ± 0.038 Å ({\textasciitilde}11 \%).

Although several theoretical studies have suggested an electronic phase transition in molybdenum disulphide, there has been a lack of experimental evidence. Here we report comprehensive studies on the pressure-dependent electronic, vibrational, optical and structural properties of multilayered molybdenum disulphide up to 35â €‰GPa. Our experimental results reveal a structural lattice distortion followed by an electronic transition from a semiconducting to metallic state at ∼19â €‰GPa, which is confirmed by ab initio calculations. The metallization arises from the overlap of the valance and conduction bands owing to sulphur-sulphur interactions as the interlayer spacing reduces. The electronic transition affords modulation of the opto-electronic gain in molybdenum disulphide.

	abstract = {Layered semiconductors based on transition-metal chalcogenides usually cross from indirect bandgap in the bulk limit over to direct bandgap in the quantum (2D) limit. Such a crossover can be achieved by peeling off a multilayer sample to a single layer. For exploration of physical behavior and device applications, it is much desired to reversibly modulate such crossover in a multilayer sample. Here we demonstrate that, in a few-layer sample where the indirect bandgap and direct bandgap are nearly degenerate, the temperature rise can effectively drive the system toward the 2D limit by thermally decoupling neighboring layers via interlayer thermal expansion. Such a situation is realized in few-layer MoSe2, which shows stark contrast from the well-explored MoS2 where the indirect and direct bandgaps are far from degenerate. Photoluminescence of few-layer MoSe2 is much enhanced with the temperature rise, much like the way that the photoluminescence is enhanced due to the bandgap crossover going from the bulk to the quantum limit, offering potential applications involving external modulation of optical properties in 2D semiconductors. The direct bandgap of MoSe2, identified at 1.55 eV, may also promise applications in energy conversion involving solar spectrum, as it is close to the optimal bandgap value of single-junction solar cells and photoelechemical devices. © 2012 American Chemical Society.},

Excited state molecular dynamics calculations using time-dependent density functional theory show an 11.3\% transient interlayer contraction of h-BN due to an interlayer dipole-dipole attraction of the laser-pumped A2u mode. These results are applicable to other layered compound materials. Such layered materials are a good material for nanospace chemistry, e.g., intercalating molecules and acting with them, and IR irradiation to contract the interlayer distance could provide a new route for chemical reactions under pressure.

As such, it has a central role in modern device physics and technology and governs the operation of semiconductor devices such as p-n junctions, transistors, photodiodes and lasers. A tunable bandgap would be highly desirable because it would allow great flexibility in design and optimization of such devices, in particular if it could be tuned by applying a variable external electric field. However, in conventional materials, the bandgap is fixed by their crystalline structure, preventing such bandgap control. Here we demonstrate the realization of a widely tunable electronic bandgap in electrically gated bilayer graphene. Using a dual-gate bilayer graphene field-effect transistor (FET) and infrared microspectroscopy, we demonstrate a gate-controlled, continuously tunable bandgap of up to 250meV. Our technique avoids uncontrolled chemical doping and provides direct evidence of a widely tunable bandgapspanning a spectral range from zero to mid-infraredthat has eluded previous attempts.

Halide perovskites—an emerging family of tunable semiconductors with desirable properties—are attractive for applications such as solution-processed solar cells, light-emitting diodes, detectors and lasers8–15. Their inherently soft crystal lattice allows greater tolerance to lattice mismatch, making them promising for heterostructure formation and semiconductor integration16,17. Atomically sharp epitaxial interfaces are necessary to improve performance and for device miniaturization. However, epitaxial growth of atomically sharp heterostructures of halide perovskites has not yet been achieved, owing to their high intrinsic ion mobility, which leads to interdiffusion and large junction widths18–21, and owing to their poor chemical stability, which leads to decomposition of prior layers during the fabrication of subsequent layers. Therefore, understanding the origins of this instability and identifying effective approaches to suppress ion diffusion are of great importance22–26. Here we report an effective strategy to substantially inhibit in-plane ion diffusion in two-dimensional halide perovskites by incorporating rigid π-conjugated organic ligands. We demonstrate highly stable and tunable lateral epitaxial heterostructures, multiheterostructures and superlattices. Near-atomically sharp interfaces and epitaxial growth are revealed by low-dose aberration-corrected high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Molecular dynamics simulations confirm the reduced heterostructure disorder and larger vacancy formation energies of the two-dimensional perovskites in the presence of conjugated ligands.

By selectively patterning nucleation sites on monolayer or bilayer s-TMDs, we precisely control the nucleation and growth of diverse m-TMDs with designable periodic arrangements and tunable lateral dimensions at the predesignated spatial locations, producing a series of vdWH arrays, including VSe2/WSe2, NiTe2/WSe2, CoTe2/WSe2, NbTe2/WSe2, VS2/WSe2, VSe2/MoS2 and VSe2/WS2. Systematic scanning transmission electron microscopy studies reveal nearly ideal vdW interfaces with widely tunable moiré superlattices.

	abstract = {Free electron beams such as those employed in electron microscopes have evolved into powerful tools to investigate photonic nanostructures with an unrivaled combination of spatial and spectral precision through the analysis of electron energy losses and cathodoluminescence light emission. In combination with ultrafast optics, the emerging field of ultrafast electron microscopy utilizes synchronized femtosecond electron and light pulses that are aimed at the sampled structures, holding the promise to bring simultaneous sub-Å-sub-fs-sub-meV space-time-energy resolution to the study of material and optical-field dynamics. In addition, these advances enable the manipulation of the wave function of individual free electrons in unprecedented ways, opening sound prospects to probe and control quantum excitations at the nanoscale. Here, we provide an overview of photonics research based on free electrons, supplemented by original theoretical insights and discussion of several stimulating challenges and opportunities. In particular, we show that the excitation probability by a single electron is independent of its wave function, apart from a classical average over the transverse beam density profile, whereas the probability for two or more modulated electrons depends on their relative spatial arrangement, thus reflecting the quantum nature of their interactions. We derive first-principles analytical expressions that embody these results and have general validity for arbitrarily shaped electrons and any type of electron-sample interaction. We conclude with some perspectives on various exciting directions that include disruptive approaches to noninvasive spectroscopy and microscopy, the possibility of sampling the nonlinear optical response at the nanoscale, the manipulation of the density matrices associated with free electrons and optical sample modes, and appealing applications in optical modulation of electron beams, all of which could potentially revolutionize the use of free electrons in photonics.},

The transfer of an optical phase onto a quantum wavefunction is a defining aspect of coherent interactions and forms the basis of quantum state preparation, synchronization and metrology. Light-phase-modulated electron states near atoms and molecules are essential for the techniques of attosecond science, including the generation of extreme-ultraviolet pulses and orbital tomography. In contrast, the quantum-coherent phase-modulation of energetic free-electron beams has not been demonstrated, although it promises direct access to ultrafast imaging and spectroscopy with tailored electron pulses on the attosecond scale. Here we demonstrate the coherent quantum state manipulation of free-electron populations in an electron microscope beam. We employ the interaction of ultrashort electron pulses with optical near-fields to induce Rabi oscillations in the populations of electron momentum states, observed as a function of the optical driving field. Excellent agreement with the scaling of an equal-Rabi multilevel quantum ladder is obtained, representing the observation of a light-driven 'quantum walk' coherently reshaping electron density in momentum space. We note that, after the interaction, the optically generated superposition of momentum states evolves into a train of attosecond electron pulses. Our results reveal the potential of quantum control for the precision structuring of electron densities, with possible applications ranging from ultrafast electron spectroscopy and microscopy to accelerator science and free-electron lasers.},

The nanobubbles exhibit Landau levels that form in the presence of strain-induced pseudo-magnetic fields greater than 300 tesla.

The effects and devices reviewed include slow-wave radiators [such as erenkov, Smith-Purcell, and TWT (traveling-wave tube) effects and devices], periodic bremsstrahlung radiators [such as undulator radiation, magnetic bremsstrahlung FEL's (free-electron lasers), and coherent bremsstrahlung in the crystal lattice], and transverse-binding radiators [such as the CRM (cyclotron resonance maser) and channeling radiation]. Starting from a general quantum- electrodynamic model, both quantum and classical effects and operating regimes of these radiation devices are described. The article provides a unified physical description of the interaction kinematics, and presents equations for the characterization of spontaneous and stimulated radiative emission in these various effects and devices. Universal relations between the spontaneous and stimulated emission parameters are revealed and shown to be related (in the quantum limit) to Einstein relations for atomic radiators and (in the classical limit) to the relations derived by Madey for magnetic bremsstrahlung FEL for on-axis radiative emission. Examples for the application of the formulation are given, estimating the feasibility of channeling radiation x-ray laser and optical regime Smith-Purcell FEL, and deriving the gain equations of magnetic bremsstrahlung FEL and CRM for arbitrary electron propagation direction, structure (wiggler) axis, and radiative emission angle. © 1988 The American Physical Society.},

Through combined computational and electron microscopy experiments, we measure the bending stiffness of graphene, obtaining 1.2–1.7 eV for a monolayer. Moreover, we find that the bending stiffness of few-layer graphene decreases sharply as a function of bending angle, tuning by almost 400\% for trilayer graphene. This softening results from shear, slip and the onset of superlubricity between the atomic layers and corresponds with a gradual change in scaling power from cubic to linear. Our results provide a unified model for bending in two-dimensional materials and show that their multilayers can be orders of magnitude softer than previously thought, among the most flexible electronic materials currently known.},

Electron microscopes currently offer the unparalleled ability of rendering spatially resolved electron spectra with combined meV and sub-nm resolution, while the use of ultrafast optical pulses enables fs temporal resolution and exposure of the electrons to ultraintense confined optical fields. Here, we theoretically investigate fundamental aspects of the interaction of fast electrons with localized optical modes that are made possible by these advances. We use a quantum optics description of the optical field to predict that the resulting electron spectra strongly depend on the statistics of the sample excitations (bosonic or fermionic) and their population (Fock, coherent, or thermal), whose autocorrelation functions are directly retrieved from the ratios of electron gain intensities. We further explore feasible experimental scenarios to probe the quantum characteristics of the sampled excitations and their populations. In particular, we present realistic simulations for electron beams interacting with optical cavities infiltrated with optically pumped quantum emitters, which we show to undergo a varied temporal evolution in the cavity mode statistics that causes radical modifications in the transmitted electron spectra depending on pump-electron delay.},

Such kind of intensity patterns are well-known for visible light, but have been sparsely discussed for X-rays. The variation of irradiation density may be predicted in case of known shapes. Analogously to light optics, the intensity distributions cover several orders of magnitude including complete extinction. The partly convergent (and divergent) caustic stripes originate from narrow zones of typical size of some 10−6 of the boundary curvature radius. For the deflection of plane wave synchrotron radiation (energy in the range of some keV to some ten keV) at rods and tubes of several μm diameter, we find good agreement between experiments and modeling by ray tracing according to Snell's law without additional diffraction contributions.

However, such structures are not readily prepared via the layer-stacking techniques, and direct growth favors the thermodynamically preferred TMDC alloys. We report the two-step epitaxial growth of lateral WSe2-MoS2 heterojunction, where the edge of WSe2 induces the epitaxial MoS2 growth despite a large lattice mismatch. The epitaxial growth process offers a controllable method to obtain lateral heterojunction with an atomically sharp interface.},

	abstract = {Mg rechargeable batteries (MgRBs) represent a safe and high-energy battery technology but suffer from the lack of suitable cathode materials due to the slow solid-state diffusion of the highly polarizing divalent Mg ion. Previous methods improve performance at the cost of incompatibility with anode/electrolyte and drastic decrease in volumetric energy density. Herein we report interlayer expansion as a general and effective atomic-level lattice engineering approach to transform inactive intercalation hosts into efficient Mg storage materials without introducing adverse side effects. As a proof-of-concept we have combined theory, synthesis, electrochemical measurement, and kinetic analysis to improve Mg diffusion behavior in MoS2, which is a poor Mg transporting material in its pristine form. First-principles simulations suggest that expanded interlayer spacing allows for fast Mg diffusion because of weakened Mg-host interactions. Experimentally, the expansion was realized by inserting a controlled amount of poly(ethylene oxide) into the lattice of MoS2 to increase the interlayer distance from 0.62 nm to up to 1.45 nm. The expansion boosts Mg diffusivity by 2 orders of magnitude, effectively enabling the otherwise barely active MoS2 to approach its theoretical storage capacity as well as to achieve one of the highest rate capabilities among Mg-intercalation materials. The interlayer expansion approach can be leveraged to a wide range of host materials for the storage of various ions, leading to novel intercalation chemistry and opening up new opportunities for the development of advanced materials for next-generation energy storage.},

Here, we supplement this picture by showing through first-principles theory that light and free-electron pulses can interfere when interacting with a nanostructure, giving rise to a modulation in the spectral distribution of the cathodoluminescence light emission that is strongly dependent on the electron wave function. Specifically, for a temporally focused electron, cathodoluminescence can be canceled upon illumination with a spectrally modulated dimmed laser that is phase-locked relative to the electron density profile. We illustrate this idea with realistic simulations under attainable conditions in currently available ultrafast electron microscopes. We further argue that the interference between excitations produced by light and free electrons enables the manipulation of the ultrafast materials response by combining the spectral and temporal selectivity of the light with the atomic resolution of electron beams.},

We evaluate both temporal and spatial resolution by means of phantom scans. We present first patient scans to illustrate the performance of DSCT for ECG-gated cardiac imaging, and we demonstrate first results using a dual-energy acquisition mode. Using ECG-gated single-segment reconstruction, the DSCT system provides 83 ms temporal resolution independent of the patient's heart rate for coronary CT angiography (CTA) and evaluation of basic functional parameters. With dual-segment reconstruction, the mean temporal resolution is 60 ms (minimum temporal resolution 42 ms) for advanced functional evaluation. The z-flying focal spot technique implemented in the evaluated DSCT system allows 0.4 mm cylinders to be resolved at all heart rates. First clinical experience shows a considerably increased robustness for the imaging of patients with high heart rates.

Since more than 120 years, bremsstrahlung from X-ray tubes has been the workhorse of medical diagnostics. Generated by X-ray segments comprised of X-ray tubes and high-voltage generators in the various medical systems, X-ray photons in the spectral range between about 16 keV and 150 keV deliver information about anatomy and function of human patients and in pre-clinical animal studies. Despite of strides to employ the wave nature of X-rays as phase sensitive means, commercial diagnostic X-ray systems available until the time of writing still rely exclusively on measuring the attenuation and scattering of X-rays by matter. Significant activities in research aim at building highly brilliant short pulse X-ray sources, based on e.g. synchrotron radiation, free electron lasers and/or laser wake-field acceleration of electrons followed by wiggling with magnetic structures or Thomson scattering in bunches of light. While both approaches, non-brilliant and brilliant sources, have different scope of application, we speculate that a combination may expand the efficacy in medical application. At this point, however, severe technical and commercial difficulties hinder closing this gap. This article may inspire further development and spark innovation in this important field.},

The spatial resolution of the spectrometer with the half lens of a working (focal) distance of 30 mm was 171 μ mat Fe Kα, which was evaluated by a wire scanning method. In this setup, it is easy to replace the polycapillary X-ray half lens with one having a different analytical performance, because a precise position-adjustment of the X-ray lens is not required. The spacial resolution with the half lens of a working distance of 16 mm was 106 μ mat Fe Kα. Depending on analyzing area on the sample and required spatial resolution, we can easily change the X-ray lens, as in a conventional optical microscope. The calibration curves of V, Cr, Mn, and Ni measured for standard steel materials showed good linear relationships (correlation coefficients {\textgreater}0.993).

Although single-nanometre resolutions in various hard-X-ray analytical methods are theoretically possible with a focused hard-X-ray beam, fabrication of the focusing optics remains the main hurdle. Aberrations owing to imperfections in the optical system degrade the quality of the focused beam. Here, we describe an in situ wavefront-correction approach to overcome this and demonstrate an X-ray beam focused in one direction to a width of 7 nm at 20 keV. We achieved focal spot improvement of the X-ray nanobeam produced by a laterally graded multilayer mirror. A grazing-incidence deformable mirror was used to restore the wavefront shape. Using this system, ideal focusing conditions are achievable even if hard-X-ray focusing elements do not achieve sufficient performance. It is believed that this will ultimately lead to single-nanometre spatial resolution in X-ray analytical methods. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

By coupling the intrinsically nonradiative energy bound at the source current sheet to the out-of-plane electric dipole and in-plane magnetic dipole of the C-aperture resonator, we are able to excite cross-polarized light thanks to the bianisotropic nature of the metasurface. The polarization direction of the emitted light is aligned with the orientation of the C-aperture resonator. Furthermore, the efficiency of the Smith-Purcell emission from Babinet metasurfaces is significantly increased by 84\%, in comparison with the case of conventional gratings. These findings not only open up a new way to manipulate the electron-beam-induced emission in the near-field region but also promise compact, tunable, and efficient light sources and particle detectors.},

The growing demand for highly tunable, high-brightness lab-scale x-ray sources motivates research of new mechanisms of x-ray generation. Parametric x-ray radiation (PXR) is a mechanism for tunable x-ray radiation from free electrons traversing crystalline materials. Although PXR has been investigated over decades, it remained limited in usages due to the low flux and strict dependence on fixed crystal properties. Here, we find new effects hiding in the PXR mechanisms, which provide control over the radiation polarization and spatial and temporal distribution. The radiation can form ultrashort pulses and delta-pulse trains, which makes the new effects fundamentally different from all conventional mechanisms of x-ray generation. We show how these new effects can be created from free-electron interactions with van der Waals materials. Furthermore, we consider free electrons traversing near material edges, which provides an additional degree of tunability in angular distribution and polarization of PXR. Our findings enable us to utilize recent breakthroughs in the atomic-scale design of 2D material heterostructures to provide platforms for creating tunable x-ray pulses.},

	abstract = {Conventional optical components such as lenses, waveplates and holograms rely on light propagation over distances much larger than the wavelength to shape wavefronts. In this way substantial changes of the amplitude, phase or polarization of light waves are gradually accumulated along the optical path. This Review focuses on recent developments on flat, ultrathin optical components dubbed 'metasurfaces' that produce abrupt changes over the scale of the free-space wavelength in the phase, amplitude and/or polarization of a light beam. Metasurfaces are generally created by assembling arrays of miniature, anisotropic light scatterers (that is, resonators such as optical antennas). The spacing between antennas and their dimensions are much smaller than the wavelength. As a result the metasurfaces, on account of Huygens principle, are able to mould optical wavefronts into arbitrary shapes with subwavelength resolution by introducing spatial variations in the optical response of the light scatterers. Such gradient metasurfaces go beyond the well-established technology of frequency selective surfaces made of periodic structures and are extending to new spectral regions the functionalities of conventional microwave and millimetre-wave transmit-arrays and reflect-arrays. Metasurfaces can also be created by using ultrathin films of materials with large optical losses. By using the controllable abrupt phase shifts associated with reflection or transmission of light waves at the interface between lossy materials, such metasurfaces operate like optically thin cavities that strongly modify the light spectrum. Technology opportunities in various spectral regions and their potential advantages in replacing existing optical components are discussed. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Owing to the depth to which hard X-rays penetrate into most materials, it is commonly accepted that the only way to realize hard-X-ray mirrors with near 100\% reflectance is under conditions of total external reflection at grazing incidence to a surface. At angles away from grazing incidence, substantial reflectance of hard X-rays occurs only as a result of constructive interference of the waves scattered from periodically ordered atomic planes in crystals (Bragg diffraction). Theory predicts that even at normal incidence the reflection of X-rays from diamond under the Bragg condition should approach 100\%substantially higher than from any other crystal. Here we demonstrate that commercially produced synthetic diamond crystals do indeed show an unprecedented reflecting power at normal incidence and millielectronvolt-narrow reflection bandwidths for hard X-rays. Bragg diffraction measurements of reflectivity and the energy bandwidth show remarkable agreement with theory. Such properties are valuable to the development of hard-X-ray optics, and could greatly assist the realization of fully coherent X-ray sources, such as X-ray free-electron laser oscillators. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

	abstract = {We demonstrate synthesis of a new type of heterostructures that comprise two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets (NSs) epitaxially grown at one-dimensional (1D) nanowires (NWs). The synthesis involves materials with a graphite-like layered structure in which covalently bonded layers are held by weak van der Waals forces. GeS was used as a prototype material in this work. The synthesis also involves a seeded-growth process, where GeS NWs are grown first as seeds followed by a seeded growth of NSs at the pre-grown NWs. We observe that exposing the pre-grown NWs to air prior to the seeded growth is critical for the formation of NSs to yield NS-NW heterostructures. Our experimental results suggest that this might be due to a mild oxidation at the NW surface caused by the air exposure, which could subsequently facilitate the nucleation of NSs at the NWs. It also suggests that the surface oxidation needs to be controlled in a proper range in order to achieve optimized NS growths. We believe that this synthetic strategy may generally apply to the growth of NS-NW heterostructures of other layered chalcogenide materials. NS-NW heterostructures provide capabilities to monolithically integrate the functionality of 1D NWs and 2D NSs into a 3D space. It holds great potential in applications that request complex nanomaterials with multiple functionality, high surface area, and efficient charge transport, such as energy storage, chemical sensing, solar energy conversion, and 3D electric and photonic devices. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {The science of x-rays is by now over 125years old, starting with Wilhelm Röntgen's discovery of x-rays in 1895, for which Röntgen was awarded the first Nobel Prize in Physics. X-rays have fundamentally changed the world in areas, including medical imaging, security scanners, industrial inspection, materials development, and drugs spectroscopy. X-ray science has been so far responsible for over 25 Nobel Prizes in Physics, Chemistry, and Medicine/Physiology. With x-ray generation being a highly commercialized, widely adopted technology, it may appear that there is little left to discover regarding the fundamentals of x-ray science. Contrary to this notion, recent years have shown renewed interest in the research and development of innovative x-ray concepts. We highlight, in this Perspective, promising directions for future research in x-ray science that result from advances in quantum science and in nanomaterials. Specifically, we describe three key opportunities for advancing x-ray science in the near future: (1) emerging material platforms for x-ray generation, especially 2D materials and their heterostructures; (2) free-electron-driven emission of entangled photon-photon and electron-photon pairs for x-ray quantum optics; and (3) shaping free-electron wavepackets for controllable x-ray emission. These research directions could lead to improvements in x-ray resonance fluoroscopy, high-contrast x-ray imaging, stimulated coherent x rays, x-ray superradiance, and other prospects for x-ray quantum optics.},

In particular, they are promising candidates for monochromatic, table-top X-ray sources. This work reveals that the versatility of the table-top vdW X-ray source goes beyond what has been demonstrated so far. By introducing a tilt angle between the vdW structure and the incident electron beam, it is theoretically and experimentally shown that the accessible photon energy range is more than doubled. This allows for greater versatility in real-time tuning of the vdW X-ray source. Furthermore, this work shows that the accessible photon energy range is maximized by simultaneously controlling both the electron energy and the vdW structure tilt. These results will pave the way for highly tunable, compact X-ray sources, with potential applications including hyperspectral X-ray fluoroscopy and X-ray quantum optics.},

Dahan et al. observed that all experiments to date in which light interacts with free electrons have been described with light considered as a wave (see the Perspective by Carbone). The authors present experimental evidence revealing the quantum nature of the interaction between photons and free electrons. They combine an ultrafast transmission electron microscope with a silicon-photonic nanostructure that confines and strengthens the interaction between the light and the electrons. The ?quantum? statistics of the photons are imprints onto the propagating electrons and are seen directly in their energy spectrum. ?ISO The quantum nature of light?matter interactions is revealed by ultrafast transmission electron microscopy. The interaction between free electrons and light stands at the base of both classical and quantum physics, with applications in free-electron acceleration, radiation sources, and electron microscopy. Yet to this day, all experiments involving free-electron?light interactions are fully explained by describing the light as a classical wave. We observed quantum statistics effects of photons on free-electron?light interactions. We demonstrate interactions that pass continuously from Poissonian to super-Poissonian and up to thermal statistics, revealing a transition from quantum walk to classical random walk on the free-electron energy ladder. The electron walker serves as the probe in nondestructive quantum detection, measuring the second-order photon-correlation g(2)(0) and higher-orders g(n)(0). Unlike conventional quantum-optical detectors, the electron can perform both quantum weak measurements and projective measurements by evolving into an entangled joint state with the photons. These findings inspire hitherto inaccessible concepts in quantum optics, including free-electron?based ultrafast quantum tomography of light.},

Such electron microscopes provide platforms for shaping quantum states of light through a judicious choice of the input light and electron states. Specifically, we show how electron energy combs implement photon displacement operations, creating displaced-Fock and displaced-squeezed states. We develop the theory for consecutive electron-cavity interactions with a common cavity and show how to generate any target Fock state. Looking forward, exploiting the degrees of freedom of electrons, light, and their interaction may achieve complete control over the quantum state of the generated light, leading to novel light statistics and correlations.},

Similar to visible light optics, one way to tackle chromatic aberration is by combining a focusing and a defocusing optic with different dispersive powers.

Upon exciting with e-beam, directional THz radiations with wide-band spectrum containing several sharp peaks are obtained only from the one of the edge of the grating, which cannot be expected from the conventional theory of Smith-Purcell radiation. It was clarified that each modes originate from different locations on the graded grating reflecting different dispersion characteristics of spoof surface plasmon polariton (spoof SPP) at each locations, and they can propagate toward only the shallower groove as a surface wave due to the cutoff at each locations, and all of these modes eventually emitted from the one of the edge of the graded grating. These directional radiations can be directed toward either backward or forward by making the groove depth deeper or shallower. The lowest and the highest frequency of the radiation can be chosen by appropriately designing the deepest and the shallowest groove depths, respectively. These unique radiations cannot be obtained from the uniformly grooved grating.

Consequently, they take part in many applications such as on-chip light sources, particle accelerators, and medical imaging. While their spectral tunability is extremely high, their polarizability is usually much harder to control. Such limitations are especially apparent in all free electron based spontaneous radiation sources, such as the Smith?Purcell (SP) radiation. Here, anomalous free-electron radiation phenomenon is demonstrated at the microwave regime from gradient bianisotropic metasurfaces, by using a phased dipole array to mimics moving charged particles. The phase gradient and the bianisotropy in metasurfaces provide new degrees of freedom for the polarization shaping of free-electron radiation, going beyond the common spectral and angular shaping.

Various passive and active components such as absorbers, filters, polarizers, and focusing lenses have been developed for manipulating terahertz radiation. With the further evolution of metamaterials and metasurfaces, unprecedented freedom is gained for flexibly controlling terahertz waves, including focusing, deflection, beam steering, polarization conversion, and generation of orbit angular momentum. Among them, terahertz beam steering has become the focus of considerable interest owing to its significance for wireless communication, high-resolution imaging, and radar applications. In this paper, first the conventional terahertz beam steering technologies are reviewed, including mechanical scanning, phased array, frequency scanning antennas, and multibeam switching technology. Then, the reconfigurable metasurface routes based on semiconductor active components, phase transition materials, electrically tunable materials, and micro-electromechanical technology are summarized and the respective performances for terahertz beam steering are discussed. Moreover, programmable metasurfaces with digitalized description of metasurfaces and real-time manipulations of radiation patterns are also illustrated in detail. Finally, a summary of the present terahertz beam steering technologies is provided and an outlook for the future is discussed.},

Here, we introduce a C-shape-split-ring-based phase discontinuity metasurface with liquid crystal elastomer as the substrate for infrared modulation of terahertz wavefront. Line-focused infrared light is applied to manipulate the deflection of the liquid crystal elastomer substrate, enabling controllable and broadband wavefront steering with a maximum output angle change of 22° at 0.68 THz. Heating as another control method is also investigated and compared with infrared control. We further demonstrate the performance of liquid crystal elastomer metasurface as a beam steerer, frequency modulator, and tunable beam splitter, which are highly desired in terahertz wireless communication and imaging systems. The proposed scheme demonstrates the promising prospects of mechanically deformable metasurfaces, thereby paving the path for the development of reconfigurable metasurfaces.},

All liquids and solids if bombarded by fast electrons, such as \$β\$-electrons or Compton electrons produced by \$γ\$-rays, do emit a peculiar visible radiation, quite different from the eventual ordinary flourescence. This radiation is partially polarized, the electric oscillation vector being parallel to the electron beam, and its intensity can be reduced neither by temperature nor by addition to the liquid bombarded of quenching substances. The peculiarity of these carac-teristics was scrutinized by Wawilow (2) who suggested that this radiation must be connected with the «Bremsung» of fast electrons. Since then a new and undoubtedly the most peculiar characteristic of the phenomenon was discovered, namely, its highly pronounced asymmetry, the intensity of light emitted, in the direction of the motion of electrons being many times larger than in the backward direction. It follows that the substance bombarded radiates coherently for the space of at least one wavelength of the visible light.},

Tunable free-electron-based light generation from nanoscale silicon gratings with efficiencies approaching those from metallic gratings is demonstrated.

However, coherent stimulated emission of free electrons, which is essential for free-electron light sources, and its dynamical amplification process remain to be disclosed in a clear, unambiguous and calibrated manner. Here we present the coherent amplification of terahertz surface plasmon polaritons via free-electron-stimulated emission: a femtosecond optical pulse creates an in-phase free-electron pulse with an initial terahertz surface wave, and their ensuing interactions intensify the terahertz surface wave coherently. The underlying dynamics of the amplification, including a twofold redshift in the radiation frequency over a one-millimetre interaction length, are resolved as electromagnetic-field-profile evolutions using an optical pump–probe method. By extending the approach to a properly phase-matched electron bunch, our theoretical analysis predicts a super-radiant surface-wave growth, which lays the ground for a stimulated surface-wave light source and may facilitate capable means for matter manipulation, especially in the terahertz band.},

	abstract = {The emission of light from charged particles underlies a wealth of scientific phenomena and technological applications. Classical theory determines the emitted photon energy by assuming an undeflected charged particle trajectory. In 1940, Ginzburg pointed out that this assumption breaks down in quantum electrodynamics, resulting in shifts—known as quantum recoil—in outgoing photon energies from their classically predicted values. Since then, quantum recoil in free-electron light-emission processes, including Cherenkov radiation and Smith–Purcell radiation, has been well-studied in theory, but an experimental demonstration has remained elusive. Here we present an experimental demonstration of quantum recoil, showing that this quantum electrodynamical effect is not only observable at room temperature but also robust in the presence of other electron-scattering mechanisms. By scattering free electrons off the periodic two-dimensional atomic sheets of van der Waals materials in a tabletop platform, we show that the X-ray photon energy is accurately predicted only by quantum recoil theory. We show that quantum recoil can be enormous, to the point that a classically predicted X-ray photon is emitted as an extremely low-energy photon. We envisage quantum recoil as a means of precision control over outgoing photon and electron spectra, and show that quantum recoil can be tailored through a host of parameters: the electron energy, the atomic composition and the tilt angle of the van der Waals material. Our results pave the way to tabletop, room-temperature platforms for harnessing and investigating quantum electrodynamical effects in electron–photon interactions.},

Here, we propose a scheme to generate pure entanglement between designated optical-cavity excitations and separable free-electron states. We shape the electron wave function profile to select the accessible cavity modes and simultaneously associate them with targeted electron scattering directions. This concept is exemplified through theoretical calculations of free-electron entanglement with degenerate and nondegenerate plasmon modes in silver nanoparticles and atomic vibrations in an inorganic molecule. The generated entanglement can be further propagated through its electron component to extend quantum interactions beyond existing protocols.

	abstract = {Interactions between light and matter play an instrumental role in spectroscopy, sensing, quantum information processing and lasers. In most of these applications, light is considered in terms of electromagnetic plane waves propagating at the speed of light in vacuum. As a result, light–matter interactions can usually be treated as very weak and captured at the lowest order in quantum electrodynamics. However, progress in understanding the coupling of photons to material quasiparticles (plasmons, phonons and excitons) brings the need for a generalized view of the photon at the core of every light–matter interaction. In this new picture, the photon can have greatly different polarization and dispersion and be confined to the scale of a few nanometres. Such photonic quasiparticles enable a wealth of otherwise unobservable light–matter interaction phenomena, in interactions with both bound and free electrons. This Review focuses on the theoretical and experimental developments in realizing new light–matter interactions with photonic quasiparticles. Examples include room-temperature strong coupling, ultrafast ‘forbidden’ transitions in atoms and new applications of the Cherenkov effect, as well as breakthroughs in ultrafast electron microscopy and new concepts for compact X-ray sources.},

The dynamic creation of a set of electron probes with different phase symmetry is demonstrated, thereby bringing adaptive optics in TEM one step closer to reality.

	abstract = {In soft ferromagnetic materials, the smoothly varying magnetization leads to the formation of fundamental patterns such as domains, vortices and domain walls. These have been studied extensively in thin films of thicknesses up to around 200 nanometres, in which the magnetization is accessible with current transmission imaging methods that make use of electrons or soft X-rays. In thicker samples, however, in which the magnetization structure varies throughout the thickness and is intrinsically three dimensional, determining the complex magnetic structure directly still represents a challenge. We have developed hard-X-ray vector nanotomography with which to determine the three-dimensional magnetic configuration at the nanoscale within micrometre-sized samples. We imaged the structure of the magnetization within a soft magnetic pillar of diameter 5 micrometres with a spatial resolution of 100 nanometres and, within the bulk, observed a complex magnetic configuration that consists of vortices and antivortices that form cross-tie walls and vortex walls along intersecting planes. At the intersections of these structures, magnetic singularities - Bloch points - occur. These were predicted more than fifty years ago but have so far not been directly observed. Here we image the three-dimensional magnetic structure in the vicinity of the Bloch points, which until now has been accessible only through micromagnetic simulations, and identify two possible magnetization configurations: a circulating magnetization structure and a twisted state that appears to correspond to an 'anti-Bloch point'. Our imaging method enables the nanoscale study of topological magnetic structures in systems with sizes of the order of tens of micrometres. Knowledge of internal nanomagnetic textures is critical for understanding macroscopic magnetic properties and for designing bulk magnets for technological applications.},

The strong time-periodic potential of intense laser light can be used to generate hybrid photon-electron states. Interaction of light with Bloch states leads to Floquet-Bloch states, which are essential in realizing new photo-induced quantum phases. Similarly, dressing of free-electron states near the surface of a solid generates Volkov states, which are used to study nonlinear optics in atoms and semiconductors. The interaction of these two dynamic states with each other remains an open experimental problem. Here we use time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (Tr-ARPES) to selectively study the transition between these two states on the surface of the topological insulator Bi 2 Se 3 . We find that the coupling between the two strongly depends on the electron momentum, providing a route to enhance or inhibit it. Moreover, by controlling the light polarization we can negate Volkov states to generate pure Floquet-Bloch states. This work establishes a systematic path for the coherent manipulation of solids via light-matter interaction.},

Control over porosity in this size range would enable the tailoring of molecular absorption and storage, separation, chemical sensing, catalytic and optical properties of such materials. Here, a universal approach for synthesizing metallic open-channel superlattices with pores of 10 to 1,000 nm from DNA-modified hollow colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) is reported. By tuning hollow NP geometry and DNA design, one can adjust crystal pore geometry (pore size and shape) and channel topology (the way in which pores are interconnected). The assembly of hollow NPs is driven by edge-to-edge rather than face-to-face DNA–DNA interactions. Two new design rules describing this assembly regime emerge from these studies and are then used to synthesize 12 open-channel superlattices with control over crystal symmetry, channel geometry and topology. The open channels can be selectively occupied by guests of the appropriate size and that are modified with complementary DNA (for example, Au NPs).},

In particular, direct control and manipulation of the phase of individual pulses within an XUV pulse sequence opens exciting possibilities for coherent control and multidimensional spectroscopy, but has not been accomplished. Here, we overcome these constraints in a highly time-stabilized and phase-modulated XUV-pump, XUV-probe experiment, which directly probes the evolution and dephasing of an inner subshell electronic coherence. This approach, avoiding any XUV optics for direct pulse manipulation, opens up extensive applications of advanced nonlinear optics and spectroscopy at XUV wavelengths.},

Free-electron lasers operating in the extreme ultraviolet and X-ray spectral regions deliver pulses with femtosecond and attosecond duration in a broad array of pump–probe configurations to study a wide range of physical processes. However, this flexibility, together with the large dimensions and high complexity of the experimental set-ups, limits control of the temporal delay to the femtosecond domain, thus precluding a time resolution below the optical cycle. Here we demonstrate a novel single-shot technique able to determine the relative synchronization between an attosecond pulse train—generated by a seeded free-electron laser—and the optical oscillations of a near-infrared field, with a resolution of one atomic unit (24 as). Using this attosecond timing tool, we report the first example of attosecond coherent control of photoionization in a two-colour field by manipulating the phase of high-order near-infrared transitions.},

We demonstrate gate-tunable negative refraction at mid-infrared frequencies using hybrid topological polaritons in van der Waals heterostructures. Specifically, we visualize wide-angle negatively refracted polaritons in α-MoO3 films partially decorated with graphene, undergoing reversible planar nanoscale focusing. Our atomically thick heterostructures weaken scattering losses at the interface while enabling an actively tunable transition of normal to negative refraction through electrical gating. We propose polaritonic negative refraction as a promising platform for infrared applications such as electrically tunable super-resolution imaging, nanoscale thermal manipulation, enhanced molecular sensing, and on-chip optical circuitry.

We offer a completely different approach: in situ measurement. That is, we integrate attosecond-pulse production and measurement in a manner that can be applied to many high-order nonlinear interactions. To demonstrate this approach, we combine a low-intensity ({\textless}10−3) second-harmonic beam with the fundamental beam, to gently perturb the production process without significantly modifying it. The attosecond-pulse duration is read from the modulation of the even-harmonic signal as a function of the two-field delay.

So far these polaritons have been limited to two classes: bulk polaritons, which propagate inside a material, and surface polaritons, which decay exponentially away from an interface. Here we report a near-field observation of ghost phonon polaritons, which propagate with in-plane hyperbolic dispersion on the surface of a polar uniaxial crystal and, at the same time, exhibit oblique wavefronts in the bulk. Ghost polaritons are an atypical non-uniform surface wave solution of Maxwell’s equations, arising at the surface of uniaxial materials in which the optic axis is slanted with respect to the interface. They exhibit an unusual bi-state nature, being both propagating (phase-progressing) and evanescent (decaying) within the crystal bulk, in contrast to conventional surface waves that are purely evanescent away from the interface. Our real-space near-field imaging experiments reveal long-distance (over 20 micrometres), ray-like propagation of deeply subwavelength ghost polaritons across the surface, verifying long-range, directional and diffraction-less polariton propagation. At the same time, we show that control of the out-of-plane angle of the optic axis enables hyperbolic-to-elliptic topological transitions at fixed frequency, providing a route to tailor the band diagram topology of surface polariton waves. Our results demonstrate a polaritonic wave phenomenon with unique opportunities to tailor nanoscale light in natural anisotropic crystals.},

When the bunched electron beam emits superradiantly, these parameters scale like the square of the number of electrons, orders of magnitude more than spontaneous emission. The formulation applies to emission from single bunches, a finite number of bunches in a macropulse, or periodic bunching. It can be employed on any kind of e-beam radiation scheme. Specific analytic expressions are derived for coherent synchrotron radiation and prebunched free-electron laser, providing a basis for comparing and understanding their connection. © 2005 The American Physical Society.},

Floquet phenomena are historically rooted in the condensed matter community, as they exploit periodic temporal drives to unveil novel phases of matter, unavailable in systems at equilibrium. In parallel, the field of metamaterials has been offering a platform for exotic wave phenomena based on tailored materials at the nanoscale, recently enhanced by incorporating time variations and switching as new degrees of freedom. In this Perspective, we connect these research areas and describe the exciting opportunities emerging from their synergy, hinging on giant wave-matter interactions enabled by metamaterials and on the exotic wave dynamics enabled by Floquet and parametric phenomena. We envision Floquet metamaterials in which nontrivial modulation dynamics, and their interplay with tailored material dispersion and nontrivial material properties such as anisotropy, non-Hermiticity and nonreciprocity, introduce a plethora of novel opportunities for wave manipulation and control.},

The time-reflected and time-refracted waves interfere, giving rise to Floquet modes with momentum bands separated by momentum gaps (rather than energy bands and energy gaps, as in photonic crystals). Here, we present a study on the emission of radiation by free electrons in PTCs. We show that a free electron moving in a PTC spontaneously emits radiation, and when associated with momentum-gap modes, the electron emission process is exponentially amplified by the modulation of the refractive index. Moreover, under strong electron-photon coupling, the quantum formulation reveals that the spontaneous emission into the PTC bandgap experiences destructive quantum interference with the emission of the electron into the PTC band modes, leading to suppression of the interdependent emission. Free-electron physics in PTCs offers a platform for studying a plethora of exciting phenomena, such as radiating dipoles moving at relativistic speeds and highly efficient quantum interactions with free electrons.},

We show that photons induce time-, orientation-, and polarization-dependent evanescent fields on the surfaces of A431 cancer cells and isolated membrane vesicles.F urthermore,t he addition of aligand to the major surface receptor on these cells and vesicles (epidermal growth factor receptor,EGFR) reduces the intensity of these fields in both preparations.Wepropose that in the absence of plasmon waves in biological samples,t hese evanescent fields reflect the changes in EGFR kinase domain polarization upon ligand binding. Aselectrons can be accelerated until their wavelengths are much smaller than one ngstrçm, electron microscopes have been able to deliver spatial information about awide variety of materials at atomic resolution. Thed evelopment of ultrafast electron microscopy (UEM) has now added atomic-scale time resolution (femtosecond) as well, providing new insight into dynamics. [1, 2] UEM achieves this by combining at ransmission electron microscope (TEM) with two femtosecond laser pulses. [3] Thef irst pulse (the "pump" or clocking pulse) is directed to the sample,w here it induces dynamic changes.T he second, "probe" pulse irradiates the TEM cathode to generate an electron (the "electron" pulse), which is then accelerated and focused onto the sample ac ontrollable number of femtoseconds after (or before) the pump pulse.I mages are built up by many millions of pump-probe events,w hich each involve as ingle electron. Over the last decade,U EM has been used to study the structure and dynamics of materials using imaging,diffraction, and electron energy loss spectroscopy as detection modes. [4-10] In the variation of UEM called photon-induced near-field electron microscopy (PINEM), the precise spatiotemporal overlap between the pump pulse and the electron pulse on the surface of an anostructure leads to an electron-photon coupling between the imaging electron and the evanescent fields induced by the pump pulse on the nanostructure surface. [11, 12] Owing to the coupling,t he electron can gain or lose energy in multiples of the photon quanta. By allowing only the electrons that gain energy to pass through the energy filter, it is possible to visualize the dynamic evanescent electromagnetic fields created on the sample surface by the pump pulse.Although still in its infancy,PINEM has already been used for instance to study the quantum behavior of Rabi oscillations, [13] the wave-particle duality of light, [14] ultrashort electron packets, [15, 16] nanoparticle entanglement, [17] dielectric properties, [18, 19] and the ultrafast dynamics of conducting nanomaterials. [20] Despite its wide applications in inorganic nanomaterials,t he biological applications of PINEM have thus far been limited to as ingle study on purified protein vesicles and Escherichia coli. [21] Photon-induced near fields were demonstrated on the aforementioned biological materials ,b ut hitherto no physical explanations have been offered for the effect in these materials,w hich lack conducting electrons. Herein, we explore the use of PINEM on human cancer cells,namely A431 cells,and membrane vesicles isolated from them and the effect of ligand binding on the electron-photon coupling on the edges of these cells and membrane vesicles. A431 human cancer cells are known to have high expression levels of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on their surface (ca. 2.5  10 6 receptors/cell). [22] EGFR is at yro-sine kinase receptor involved in cell proliferation and division and is directly implicated in the development of many cancers. [23] The1 286 amino acid receptor consists of an extracellular domain (ECD), at ransmembrane domain, aj uxtamembrane domain, ak inase domain, and an unstruc-tured C-terminal tail. Upon binding to its ligand, the epidermal growth factor (EGF), the receptor becomes phosphorylated and forms dimers on the cell surface. [24] Atomic models for isolated domains of EGFR are available from X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. [25-28] Recently,aNMR study provided insight into the dynamics and ligand-induced activation mechanism of the full-length EGFR in native membrane vesicles.

	abstract = {Coherent control of quantum dynamics is key to a multitude of fundamental studies and applications1. In the visible or longer-wavelength domains, near-resonant light fields have become the primary tool with which to control electron dynamics2. Recently, coherent control in the extreme-ultraviolet range was demonstrated3, with a few-attosecond temporal resolution of the phase control. At hard-X-ray energies (above 5–10 kiloelectronvolts), Mössbauer nuclei feature narrow nuclear resonances due to their recoilless absorption and emission of light, and spectroscopy of these resonances is widely used to study the magnetic, structural and dynamical properties of matter4,5. It has been shown that the power and scope of Mössbauer spectroscopy can be greatly improved using various control techniques6–16. However, coherent control of atomic nuclei using suitably shaped near-resonant X-ray fields remains an open challenge. Here we demonstrate such control, and use the tunable phase between two X-ray pulses to switch the nuclear exciton dynamics between coherent enhanced excitation and coherent enhanced emission. We present a method of shaping single pulses delivered by state-of-the-art X-ray facilities into tunable double pulses, and demonstrate a temporal stability of the phase control on the few-zeptosecond timescale. Our results unlock coherent optical control for nuclei, and pave the way for nuclear Ramsey spectroscopy17 and spin-echo-like techniques, which should not only advance nuclear quantum optics18, but also help to realize X-ray clocks and frequency standards19. In the long term, we envision time-resolved studies of nuclear out-of-equilibrium dynamics, which is a long-standing challenge in Mössbauer science20. Suitably shaped X-ray pulses are used to coherently steer the quantum dynamics of atoms’ nuclei rather than their electrons, with few-zeptosecond temporal stability of the phase control.},

Here, we propose a highly directional, tunable and monochromatic radiation source based on electrons interacting with graphene plasmons. Our complementary analytical theory and ab initio simulations demonstrate that the high momentum of the strongly confined graphene plasmons enables the generation of high-frequency radiation from relatively low-energy electrons, bypassing the need for lengthy electron acceleration stages or extreme laser intensities. For instance, highly directional 20 keV photons could be generated in a table-top design using electrons from conventional radiofrequency electron guns. The conductive nature and high damage threshold of graphene make it especially suitable for this application. Our electron–plasmon scattering theory is readily extended to other systems in which free electrons interact with surface waves.},

This, in turn, may provide ground-breaking applications, as it is a technology promising to miniaturize particle accelerators down to the chip scale. This fundamental interaction can also be used to study and demonstrate quantum photon-electron phenomena. The spontaneous and stimulated Smith\&\#x2013;Purcell effect and the photon-induced near-field electron-microscopy (PINEM) effect have evolved to be a fruitful ground for observing quantum effects. In particular, the energy spectrum of the free electron has been shown to have discrete energy peaks, spaced with the interacting photon energy.

Despite the enormous success of semianalytical approximations, there are certainly ranges of electron–photon coupling strengths where more demanding self-consistent analyses are to be exploited to thoroughly grasp our experimental results. Slow-electron point-projection microscopes and many of the photoemission experiments are employed within such ranges. Here, we aim to classify those regimes and propose numerical solutions for an accurate simulation model. A survey of the works carried out within self-consistent Maxwell–Lorentz and Maxwell– Schrödinger frameworks are outlined. Several applications of the proposed frameworks are discussed, and an outlook for further investigations is also delivered.},

	abstract = {Cherenkov detectors enable a valuable tool to identify high-energy particles. However, their sensitivity and momentum coverage are limited by the refractive index of host materials. Especially, identifying particles with energy above multiple gigaelectronvolts requires host materials with a near-unity refractive index, which are limited to bulky gas chambers. Overcoming this fundamental material limit is important for future particle detectors yet remains a long-standing challenge. Here, we propose a different paradigm for Cherenkov detectors that utilizes the broadband angular filter made from stacks of variable one-dimensional photonic crystals. Owing to the Brewster effect, the angular filter is transparent only to Cherenkov photons from a precise incident angle. Particle identification is achieved by mapping each Cherenkov angle to the peak-intensity position of transmitted photons in the detection plane. Such angular filtering effect, although decreases the photon number collected in the detection plane, enables the realization of a non-dispersive pseudo refractive index over the entire visible spectrum. Moreover, the pseudo refractive index can be flexibly designed to different values close to unity. Our angular-selective Brewster paradigm offers a feasible solution to implement compact and highly sensitive Cherenkov detectors especially in beam lines with a small angular divergence using regular dielectrics.},

Here we present tunable photon-induced spatial modulation of electrons through their interaction with externally controlled surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs). Using recently developed methods of shaping SPP patterns, we demonstrate a dynamic control of the electron beam with a variety of electron distributions and verify their coherence through electron diffraction. Finally, the nonlinearity stemming from energy post-selection provides us with another avenue for controlling the electron shape, generating electron features far below the SPP wavelength.

Unlike in the X-ray regime, control over light waves in the visible and IR regimes is ubiquitous in a vast range of applications, and typically relies on widely available optical components. However, analogous optical elements for X-rays are usually inefficient and challenging to fabricate. Here, we propose a method for shaping X-ray waves directly at the source, using the interaction of free electrons with crystalline materials. Specifically, by inducing strain on van der Waals materials, we control their interaction with free electrons in a manner that tunes the emissions of the X-rays and forms caustic X-ray beams. The development of wave-shaping concepts like caustics generation in the X-ray spectral range could benefit from achievements in this field in the optical range and may help bypass the noted limits of current X-ray optics technology. Looking forward, shaping the interference of X-rays at the atomic scale could enable further developments in high-resolution X-ray science.},

By counting only the electrons on the tagger ladder an intensity spectrum ranging from 50 MeV to 800 MeV was obtained with good statistical accuracy in a running time of 2 s. This short running time makes it possible to measure a complete intensity pattern versus photon energy for different orientations of the diamond crystal in about 15 minutes. By comparing these measured intensity patterns with calculations it becomes possible to precisely align the crystal axes with respect to the axes of the goniometer. Relative intensities of coherent bremsstrahlung are determined experimentally by normalizing the diamond data to data obtained with an amorphous Ni radiator. Good agreement is obtained between experiment and prediction when taking into account the beam divergence, multiple scattering of electrons in the radiator, the Z dependence of the bremsstrahlung spectrum and the finite Debye temperature of diamond. With a collimated photon beam having an aperture of half the characteristic angle degrees of linear polarization appear to be possible ranging from 80\% at 200 MeV over 65\% at 300 MeV and 55\% at 400 MeV to 35\% at 500 MeV.},

The findings reveal the dependence of the polariton wavelength and dispersion on the thickness of the material down to just a few atomic layers. Infrared nanoimaging is used to detect a type of surface collective mode in a representative van der Waals crystal. van der Waals heterostructures assembled from atomically thin crystalline layers of diverse two-dimensional solids are emerging as a new paradigm in the physics of materials. We used infrared nanoimaging to study the properties of surface phonon polaritons in a representative van der Waals crystal, hexagonal boron nitride. We launched, detected, and imaged the polaritonic waves in real space and altered their wavelength by varying the number of crystal layers in our specimens. The measured dispersion of polaritonic waves was shown to be governed by the crystal thickness according to a scaling law that persists down to a few atomic layers. Our results are likely to hold true in other polar van der Waals crystals and may lead to new functionalities.},

High harmonics with spin and orbital angular momenta are produced, opening a novel regime of angular momentum conservation that allows for manipulation of the polarization of attosecond pulses—from linear to circular—and for the generation of circularly polarized vortices with tailored orbital angular momentum, including harmonic vortices with the same topological charge as the driving laser beam.

Although the strengths of the technique for providing high-resolution structural and analytical information have been known and understood for much longer than that, the key to its more recent popularity has undoubtedly been the availability of STEM modes on instruments available from the major TEM manufacturers. Gone are the days when researchers want- ing the unique capabilities of high-resolution STEM had to undertake the task of keeping a VG dedicated STEM instrument operating. Given the current interest in the technique, we felt that the time was right to review the current state of knowledge about STEM and STEM-related techniques and their application to a range of materials problems. The purpose of this volume is both to educate those who wish to deepen their understanding of STEM and to inform those who are seeking a review of the latest applications and methods associated with STEM. We are delighted that so many of our colleagues accepted our invitation to contribute to this volume, and we are indebted to them for their efforts in creating such excellent contributions. The follow- ing chapters illustrate how close STEM has brought us to the ultimate materials characterisation challenge of analysing materials atom by atom.

Although the field is progressing swiftly, thanks to the availability of nanoscale manufacturing and analysis methods, fundamental properties such as the plasmonic excitations’ symmetries cannot be accessed directly, leading to a partial, sometimes incorrect, understanding of their properties. Here we overcome this limitation by deliberately shaping the wave function of an electron beam to match a plasmonic excitations’ symmetry in a modified transmission electron microscope. We show experimentally and theoretically that this offers selective detection of specific plasmon modes within metallic nanoparticles, while excluding modes with other symmetries. This method resembles the widespread use of polarized light for the selective excitation of plasmon modes with the advantage of locally probing the response of individual plasmonic objects and a far wider range of symmetry selection criteria.},

	abstract = {When you play a string instrument, you raise the frequency, or pitch, of the note by shortening the vibrating portion of the string: Drop the length in half, and you hear a harmonic at double the frequency. It is possible to do essentially the same thing with light waves by using selective excitation and relaxation processes of the electrons in crystals or high-pressure gases through which the beam of light is directed to produce light harmonics. Over the past decade, researchers have been optimizing the conversion of red light to the far edge of the ultraviolet, which corresponds to tens of harmonics. Popmintchev et al. (p. 1287) now show that mid-infrared light can undergo a process in high-pressure gas to generate ultrahigh harmonics up to orders greater than 5000 in the x-ray regime. An electron excitation process in a high-pressure gas converts infrared light into a well-confined beam of x-rays. High-harmonic generation (HHG) traditionally combines {\textasciitilde}100 near-infrared laser photons to generate bright, phase-matched, extreme ultraviolet beams when the emission from many atoms adds constructively. Here, we show that by guiding a mid-infrared femtosecond laser in a high-pressure gas, ultrahigh harmonics can be generated, up to orders greater than 5000, that emerge as a bright supercontinuum that spans the entire electromagnetic spectrum from the ultraviolet to more than 1.6 kilo?electron volts, allowing, in principle, the generation of pulses as short as 2.5 attoseconds. The multiatmosphere gas pressures required for bright, phase-matched emission also support laser beam self-confinement, further enhancing the x-ray yield. Finally, the x-ray beam exhibits high spatial coherence, even though at high gas density the recolliding electrons responsible for HHG encounter other atoms during the emission process.},

However, this becomes challenging in x-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs), as incident fields vary from pulse to pulse due to the stochastic nature of self-amplified stimulated emission. Despite various proposed field retrieval methods, single-shot characterization of each pulse remains elusive. To address this, we propose the speckle-correlation scattering matrix as a solution. Our method directly reconstructs the complex field without sample constraints or multiple acquisitions by introducing a designed diffuser before the detector. We demonstrate the robustness of our approach through successful field reconstructions in various experimental configurations. Based on the retrieved field results, pulse-to-pulse variations in pulse intensity, position, illumination angle, and shape were analyzed. We believe our method can readily serve as an on-field and real-time pulse diagnostic tool at XFELs and improve the overall quality of all experiments performed at XFELs.},

	abstract = {Abstract This work presents a general framework for quantum interference between processes that can involve different fundamental particles or quasi-particles. This framework shows that shaping input wavefunctions is a versatile and powerful tool for producing and controlling quantum interference between distinguishable pathways, beyond previously explored quantum interference between indistinguishable pathways. Two examples of quantum interference enabled by shaping in interactions between free electrons, bound electrons, and photons are presented: i) the vanishing of the zero-loss peak by destructive quantum interference when a shaped electron wavepacket couples to light, under conditions where the electron's zero-loss peak otherwise dominates; ii) quantum interference between free electron and atomic (bound electron) spontaneous emission processes, which can be significant even when the free electron and atom are far apart, breaking the common notion that a free electron and an atom must be close by to significantly affect each other's processes. Conclusions show that emerging quantum wave-shaping techniques unlock the door to greater versatility in light-matter interactions and other quantum processes in general.},

Here we review the basic principles of a high-gain quantum FEL starting from noise, with special emphasis on the self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) mode of operation. In the first part of the paper, a condition for the neglect of the fermionic character of the electrons is derived and the full quantum theory of the N-particle and single-radiation-mode FEL Hamiltonian is presented. Quantum effects such as cooperative gain, discrete spectrum and line narrowing are described, both in the multi-particle and in the second quantization formalism. In the second part, propagation effects (i.e. slippage) are described and the main features of the quantum SASE regime are discussed. The broad and spiky radiation spectrum observed in classical SASE reduces in the quantum regime to a series of narrow lines, associated with sequential transitions between adjacent momentum states. A simple interpretation of the discrete nature of the spectrum and of the linewidth of the single spike observed in the quantum regime is presented. © 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co.

The standing light waves, in this case, produce a periodic effect in the emulsion of the photographic plate which, when developed, scatters light and produces a similar colour effect. Instead of using a beam of light, it would seem possible to scatter electrons from the emulsion and obtain a reflection of electrons similar to that of a space grating. But it seemed to us that it would be of much greater interest to consider an experiment in which electrons are reflected from the standing waves of light. The direct scattering of free electronic waves by light has strictly never been observed, and it was thought possible that by this method, owing to the interference of the electrons and to the fact that the scattered electrons are focussed to one spot, the magnification of the phenomenon would be sufficient to make it observable. From the theory developed below, it will be seen that the experiment is just on the verge of possibility, and would be very difficult to carry out. The main interest of the experiment would come from the possibility of observing stimulated scattered radiation which up to the present has never been verified experimentally.},

	abstract = {Cherenkov radiation provides a valuable way to identify high-energy particles in a wide momentum range, through the relation between the particle velocity and the Cherenkov angle. However, since the Cherenkov angle depends only on the material’s permittivity, the material unavoidably sets a fundamental limit to the momentum coverage and sensitivity of Cherenkov detectors. For example, ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors must employ materials transparent to the frequency of interest as well as possessing permittivities close to unity to identify particles in the multi-gigaelectronvolt range, and thus are often limited to large gas chambers. It would be extremely important, albeit challenging, to lift this fundamental limit and control Cherenkov angles at will. Here we propose a new mechanism that uses the constructive interference of resonance transition radiation from photonic crystals to generate both forward and backward effective Cherenkov radiation. This mechanism can control the radiation angles in a flexible way with high sensitivity to any desired range of velocities. Photonic crystals thus overcome the material limit for Cherenkov detectors, enabling the use of transparent materials with arbitrary values of permittivity, and provide a promising versatile platform well suited for identification of particles at high energy with enhanced sensitivity.},

This Kapitza–Dirac effect is analogous to the diffraction of light by a grating, but with the roles of the wave and matter reversed. The electron and the light grating interact extremely weakly, via the ‘ponderomotive potential’5, so attempts to measure the Kapitza–Dirac effect had to wait for the development of the laser. The idea6 that the underlying interaction with light is resonantly enhanced for electrons in an atom led to the observation7 that atoms could be diffracted by a standing wave of light. Deflection of electrons by high-intensity laser light, which is also a consequence of the Kapitza–Dirac effect, has also been demonstrated8. But the coherent interference that characterizes wave diffraction has not hitherto been observed9,10.

Davisson and Germer have communicated the results of some very interesting experiments on the scattering of electrons from single crystals of nickel. They show that the distribution of scattered electrons, which have only lost a small fraction of their energy, depends on the voltage, and is in accordance with the symmetry of the crystal. The authors explain their results approximately on the basis of the Einstein - de Broglie theory of the wave electron, in a similar manner to that suggested by Elsasser (Naturwiss., 13, p. 711, 1925) in explanation of earlier experiments of Davisson and Kunsman (Phys. Rev., 22, p. 243, 1923). In particular, the explanation given is that electrons of velocity v are scattered by the nickel crystal in very nearly the same directions as those in which an electromagnetic wave of wave - length λe = h/mv would be diffracted by the cross grating formed by the uppermost layer of atoms in the face of the crystal—in this case, a (111) face which has been etched by vaporisation.},

Here we apply terahertz nanoscopy to image in-plane anisotropic low-energy PPs in monoclinic Ag2Te platelets. The hybridization of the PPs with their mirror image—by placing the platelets above a Au layer—increases the direction-dependent relative polariton propagation length and the directional polariton confinement. This allows for verifying a linear dispersion and elliptical isofrequency contour in momentum space, revealing in-plane anisotropic acoustic terahertz PPs. Our work shows high-symmetry (elliptical) polaritons on low-symmetry (monoclinic) crystals and demonstrates the use of terahertz PPs for local measurements of anisotropic charge carrier masses and damping.},

An ensemble of atoms, collectively coupled together with just one of the atoms excited will conspire to decay much faster than the single atom case. This enhancement of light-matter interaction is known as superradiance. Röhlsberger et al. (p. 1248, published online 13 May; see the cover; see the Perspective by Scully and Svidzinsky) present the realization of an artificial superradiant system comprising resonant iron atoms embedded in a semiconductor cavity and excited by synchrotron radiation and report the signature collective Lamb shift expected from the cooperative interaction and enhanced decay rate. The availability of such a controlled system to look closer at this effect should shed light on its role in natural and complex light-harvesting systems, and possibly allow the production of more efficient solar cells. Superradiance is observed from an ensemble of iron atoms excited by synchrotron radiation. Superradiance, the cooperative spontaneous emission of photons from an ensemble of identical atoms, provides valuable insights into the many-body physics of photons and atoms. We show that an ensemble of resonant atoms embedded in the center of a planar cavity can be collectively excited by synchrotron radiation into a purely superradiant state. The collective coupling of the atoms via the radiation field leads to a substantial radiative shift of the transition energy, the collective Lamb shift. We simultaneously measured the temporal evolution of the superradiant decay and the collective Lamb shift of resonant 57Fe nuclei excited with 14.4?kilo?electron volt synchrotron radiation. Our experimental technique provides a simple method for spectroscopic analysis of the superradiant emission.},

In spite of this, many forms of tailoring waves that had substantial impact on applications in the optical regime have remained out of reach in the X-ray regime. This disparity fundamentally arises from the tendency of refractive indices of all materials to approach unity at high frequencies, making X-ray-optical components such as lenses and mirrors much harder to create and often less efficient. Here, we propose a new concept for X-ray focusing based on inducing a curved wavefront into the X-ray generation process, resulting in the intrinsic focusing of X-ray waves. This concept can be seen as effectively integrating the optics to be part of the emission mechanism, thus bypassing the efficiency limits imposed by X-ray optical components, enabling the creation of nanobeams with nanoscale focal spot sizes and micrometer-scale focal lengths. Specifically, we implement this concept by designing aperiodic vdW heterostructures that shape X-rays when driven by free electrons. The parameters of the focused hotspot, such as lateral size and focal depth, are tunable as a function of an interlayer spacing chirp and electron energy. Looking forward, ongoing advances in the creation of many-layer vdW heterostructures open unprecedented horizons of focusing and arbitrary shaping of X-ray nanobeams.},

Both emission of characteristic radiation and bremsstrahlung are affected by the changes in mode density induced by the waveguide structure. We investigate how the excited modal pattern depends on the positions of the metal atoms and the distance of the focused electron beam with respect to the waveguide exit side. We compare the results to synchrotron-excited fluorescence. We then discuss how x-ray generation in waveguides can be used to increase the brilliance and directional emission of tabletop x-ray sources, with a corresponding increase in the spatial coherence.

Such an approach permits to observe the essential change of the radiation structure in the region where CBR and PXR radiation patterns overlap that may be interpreted as an interference of these two radiation mechanisms.

Making use of the many-beam (two-dimensional quantum treatment) formalism for transversely bound electrons moving through crystal lattices, we have computed ACBA spectra for 17 MeV electrons passing through a 10 μm thick diamond (C) crystal. We found that the momentum transfer occurs in the plane perpendicular to the axis of interest. Only momentum transfers along the scan direction (electron transverse momentum direction) result in a photon emission in the forward direction. Two different scans have shown that the energies of the coherent bremsstrahlung peaks depend strongly on the direction of the electron transverse momentum. We also present a comparison of the first order Born approximation and the many-beam formalism.},

Here, we report the use of nonlinear-optical two-photon transitions for the quantum-coherent control of a free-electron matter wave in free space. We superimpose an electron beam with two crossed laser beams of different photon energies for non-linear Compton scattering. At suitable angle combinations, the electron energy spectrum becomes modulated into discrete energy sidebands with thousands of interference maxima. We explain our observations by the cascaded addition and subtraction of two-photon pairs under three-body conservation of energy and momentum. Calculations reveal that the electron matter wave converts into pulses of few-attosecond duration. These results show the general importance of matter wave coherences in scattering phenomena and provide a way for investigating and creating quantum correlations and entanglement between massive and massless elementary particles without the need for a classical coupling construct.},

Launching of plasmons by swift electrons has long been used in electron energy?loss spectroscopy (EELS) to investigate the plasmonic properties of ultrathin, or two-dimensional (2D), electron systems. However, the question of how a swift electron generates plasmons in space and time has never been answered. We address this issue by calculating and demonstrating the spatial-temporal dynamics of 2D plasmon generation in graphene. We predict a jet-like rise of excessive charge concentration that delays the generation of 2D plasmons in EELS, exhibiting an analog to the hydrodynamic Rayleigh jet in a splashing phenomenon before the launching of ripples. The photon radiation, analogous to the splashing sound, accompanies the plasmon emission and can be understood as being shaken off by the Rayleigh jet?like charge concentration. Considering this newly revealed process, we argue that previous estimates on the yields of graphene plasmons in EELS need to be reevaluated.},

	abstract = {Free electrons are essential in such diverse applications as electron microscopes, accelerators and photoemission spectroscopy. However, the space charge effects of many electrons are often a problem and, when confined to extremely small space–time dimensions, even two electrons can interact strongly. Here we demonstrate that the resulting Coulomb repulsion can be highly advantageous, as it leads to strong electron–electron correlations. We show that femtosecond laser-emitted electrons from nanometric needle tips are highly anticorrelated in terms of energy because of dynamic Coulomb repulsion, with a visibility of 56\%. We extract a mean energy splitting of 3.3 eV and a correlation decay time of 82 fs. The energy-filtered electrons display a sub-Poissonian number distribution with a second-order correlation function as small as g(2) = 0.34, implying that shot-noise-reduced pulsed electron beams can be realized by simple energy filtering. We also reach the strong-field regime of laser-driven electron emission and gain insights into how the electron correlations of the different electron classes (direct or rescattered) are influenced by the strong laser fields.},

	abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) materials can confine light to volumes much shorter than the wavelength, and, together, the long propagation lengths make them attractive materials for developing nanophotonic platforms. Characterizing the spatiotemporal control of 2D polariton wave packets has been hindered for the same reasons that make their potential applications exciting: They have extremely small wavelengths and are strongly confined inside the material. Kurman et al. developed a new pump-probe technique based on electron emission that provides access to the spatiotemporal dynamics of 2D polaritons. The nanometric spatial resolution and femtosecond temporal resolution will be useful for probing the excitation dynamics of these materials. Science, abg9015, this issue p. 1181 A pump-probe electron emission technique is used image the dynamics of polaritons in 2D materials. Coherent optical excitations in two-dimensional (2D) materials, 2D polaritons, can generate a plethora of optical phenomena that arise from the extraordinary dispersion relations that do not exist in regular materials. Probing of the dynamical phenomena of 2D polaritons requires simultaneous spatial and temporal imaging capabilities and could reveal unknown coherent optical phenomena in 2D materials. Here, we present a spatiotemporal measurement of 2D wave packet dynamics, from its formation to its decay, using an ultrafast transmission electron microscope driven by femtosecond midinfrared pulses. The ability to coherently excite phonon-polariton wave packets and probe their evolution in a nondestructive manner reveals intriguing dispersion-dependent dynamics that includes splitting of multibranch wave packets and, unexpectedly, wave packet deceleration and acceleration. Having access to the full spatiotemporal dynamics of 2D wave packets can be used to illuminate puzzles in topological polaritons and discover exotic nonlinear optical phenomena in 2D materials.},

Here, we report the development of scanning ultrafast electron microscopy using a field-emission-source configuration. Scanning of pulses is made in the single-electron mode, for which the pulse contains at most one or a few electrons, thus achieving imaging without the space-charge effect between electrons, and still in ten(s) of seconds. For imaging, the secondary electrons from surface structures are detected, as demonstrated here for material surfaces and biological specimens. By recording backscattered electrons, diffraction patterns from single crystals were also obtained.

Although the small de Broglie wavelength of electron beams should allow access to attosecond and ångström dimensions20, the time resolution of ultrafast electron microscopy21 and diffraction22 has so far been limited to the femtosecond domain16–18, which is insufficient for recording fundamental material responses on the scale of the cycles of light1,2,10.

We apply a continuous-wave laser24 to modulate the electron wave function into a rapid sequence of electron pulses, and use an energy filter to resolve electromagnetic near-fields in and around a material as a movie in space and time. Experiments on nanostructured needle tips, dielectric resonators and metamaterial antennas reveal a directional launch of chiral surface waves, a delay between dipole and quadrupole dynamics, a subluminal buried waveguide field and a symmetry-broken multi-antenna response.

Intense laser pulses have paved the way to this end3,4 by demonstrating femtosecond confinement5,6 and sub-optical cycle control7,8 of the optical field emission9 from nanostructured metals.

We used intense, sub-cycle light transients to induce optical field emission of electron pulses from tungsten nanotips and a weak replica of the same transient to directly investigate the emission dynamics in real time. Access to the temporal properties of the electron pulses rescattering off the tip surface, including the duration τ = (53 as ± 5 as) and chirp, and the direct exploration of nanoscale near fields open new prospects for research and applications at the interface of attosecond physics and nano-optics.},

This fundamental quantum process lies at the heart of various applications, ranging from high brightness electron sources in d.c. operation1,2 to petahertz vacuum electronics in laser-driven operation3–8. In the latter process, the electron wavepacket undergoes semiclassical dynamics9,10 in the strong oscillating laser field, similar to strong-field and attosecond physics in the gas phase11,12. There, the subcycle electron dynamics has been determined with a stunning precision of tens of attoseconds13–15, but at solids the quantum dynamics including the emission time window has so far not been measured. Here we show that two-colour modulation spectroscopy of backscattering electrons16 uncovers the suboptical-cycle strong-field emission dynamics from nanostructures, with attosecond precision. In our experiment, photoelectron spectra of electrons emitted from a sharp metallic tip are measured as function of the relative phase between the two colours. Projecting the solution of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation onto classical trajectories relates phase-dependent signatures in the spectra to the emission dynamics and yields an emission duration of 710 ± 30 attoseconds by matching the quantum model to the experiment. Our results open the door to the quantitative timing and precise active control of strong-field photoemission from solid state and other systems and have direct ramifications for diverse fields such as ultrafast electron sources17, quantum degeneracy studies and sub-Poissonian electron beams18–21, nanoplasmonics22 and petahertz electronics23.},

Here it is discussed how one can define the pulse duration, the beam size and divergence, the transverse and longitudinal coherences, the energy spread and temporal dispersion, and the relation between bandwidth and shortest possible pulse duration, for single electrons and in practical context. Relations are provided on how to estimate these parameters from measurable quantities in a single-electron diffraction or microscopy experiment.},

For a single MWCNT it was found that while field-emission can hardly occur from the side of the nanotube, a curved nanotube may result in finite side emission and the best emission geometry is the top emission geometry. Current–voltage (I–V) measurements made at different vacuum conditions and voltage sweeps emphasize the importance of the adsorbates on the electron field emission of MWCNTs. For a contaminated MWCNT, although the field emission current was reduced, the stability of its emission was improved. A current of up to several tens of μA was observed for a single MWCNT, but it was found that long time emission usually results in drastic structure damage that may lead to sudden emission failure.},

Promising results have been reported with respect to some important requirements for such applications: a stable emitted current3,4,5 and a long lifetime6,7. Two parameters of an electron source affect the resolution of these instruments: the energy spread of the emitted electrons and a parameter called the reduced brightness, which depends on the angular current density and the virtual source size. Several authors have measured a low energy spread associated with electron emission3,7,8,9. Here we measure the reduced brightness, and find a value that is more than a factor of ten larger than provided by state-of-the-art electron sources in electron microscopes. In addition, we show that an individual multi-walled carbon nanotube emits most current into a single narrow beam. On the basis of these results, we expect that carbon nanotube electron sources will lead to a significant improvement in the performance of high-resolution electron-beam instruments.},

The dynamics of this ultrafast electron nanotransport depends on the precise temporal field profile of the optical driving pulse. Current autocorrelations are acquired with sub-femtosecond temporal resolution as a function of both pulse delay and absolute carrier-envelope phase. Quantitative modelling of the experiments enables us to monitor the spatiotemporal evolution of the electron density and currents induced in the system and to elucidate the physics underlying the electron transfer driven by strong optical fields in plasmonic gaps.

Beyond this, field-emission current noise was found to mainly comprise current step jumps and current spikes. At high emission current densities in the order of 106Acm−2, the noise changes into flicker noise. Field emission at high current density induced surface diffusion and crystallization of the disordered nanowire tip due to temperature rise at the field-emitting tip. Further increase in the emission current density initiated local arc destruction which caused shortening of the nanowire length.},

In this work, we demonstrate the preparation of electron-photon pair states using the phase-matched interaction of free electrons with the evanescent vacuum field of a photonic chip?based optical microresonator. Spontaneous inelastic scattering produces intracavity photons coincident with energy-shifted electrons, which we employ for noise-suppressed optical mode imaging. This parametric pair-state preparation will underpin the future development of free-electron quantum optics, providing a route to quantum-enhanced imaging, electron-photon entanglement, and heralded single-electron and Fock-state photon sources. The interaction of electron beams with cavities and resonant structures represents a universal scheme for generating electromagnetic radiation. Feist et al. fabricated structures with phase-matched interactions between free electrons and the vacuum cavity field of a photonic chip-based microresonator. As the electrons passed near the resonator, coupling between them and the vacuum field resulted in the spontaneous generation of photons within the cavity. Because the electron-photon pairs are correlated, they should be a useful source for the development of free-electron quantum optics providing enhanced imaging and sensing capabilities. ?ISO The parametric generation of electron-photon pair states enables heralded single-particle sources.},

Similar expressions for the angular momentum of radiation of a charge moving on a spiral trajectory are derived by use of Lorentz transformations. It is shown that the main part of angular momentum in this case is emitted at a small angle to the vortex axis. Relativistic charged particles at spiral motion are effective source of the vortex photon beams at wave lengths ranging from radio waves to gamma rays.

This implies that fundamental relativistic effects such as length contraction and time dilation can be engineered by properly tailoring the initial conditions. As an example, we suggest the possibility of extending the lifetime of decaying particles, such as an unstable hydrogen isotope, or altering other decay processes.

As a direct demonstration, we numerically reconstruct a pulsed electron wave function with a kinetic energy of 10 keV.

However, these nearfields have so far been inaccessible due to the complexity of the devices and their geometrical constraints, hampering the design of future nanophotonic accelerators. Here we image the field distribution inside a nanophotonic accelerator, for which we developed a technique for frequency-tunable deep-subwavelength resolution of nearfields based on photon-induced nearfield electron-microscopy. Our experiments, complemented by 3D simulations, unveil surprising deviations in two leading nanophotonic accelerator designs, showing complex field distributions related to intricate 3D features in the device and its fabrication tolerances.

Theoretically, metallic materials exhibiting notable surface plasmon-field enhancements can possibly generate a high electron acceleration capability. Here, we present a design for metallic material-based on-chip laser-driven accelerators that show a remarkable electron acceleration capability, as demonstrated in ultrafast electron microscopy investigations. Under phase-matching conditions, efficient and continuous acceleration of free electrons on a periodic nanostructure can be achieved. Importantly, an asymmetric spectral structure in which the vast majority of the electrons are in the energy-gain states has been obtained by means of a periodic bowtie-structure accelerator. Due to the presence of surface plasmon enhancement and nonlinear optical effects, the maximum acceleration gradient can reach as high as 0.335 GeV/m. This demonstrates that metallic laser accelerator could provide a way to develop compact accelerators on chip.},

Here, we propose a scheme to generate optical cat states based on the quantum interference of multi-path free-electron–photons interactions that take place simultaneously with strong coupling strength. By performing a projection measurement on the electron, the state of light changes significantly from a coherent state into a non-Gaussian state with either Wigner negativity or squeezing property, both possess metrological power to achieve quantum advantage. More importantly, we show that the Wigner negativity oscillates with the coupling strength, and the optical cat states are successfully generated with high fidelity at all the oscillation peaks. This oscillation reveals the quantum interference effect of the multiple quantum pathways in the interaction of the electron with photons, by that various nonclassical states of light are promising to be fast prepared and manipulated. These findings inspire further exploration of emergent quantum phenomena and advanced quantum technologies with free electrons.},

Hydrogen annealing reduces the surface roughness of the silicon pillars and mesa, making the LIDT less dependent on surface perturbations incurred during fabrication, as well as causing damage to occur at predictable locations. Hydrogen annealing decreases the range of the measured LIDT from \$ 5.3 - 10{\textbackslash};\{{\textbackslash}rm mJ/cm{\textasciicircum}2\} \$5.3−10mJ/cm2 to \$ 9.5 - 10.2{\textbackslash};\{{\textbackslash}rm mJ/cm{\textasciicircum}2\} \$9.5−10.2mJ/cm2 with 1960 nm 300 fs pulses. Additionally, 90 nm of low-stress silicon nitride film coating on the annealed DLA improves the damage fluence by 27\%. Smoother interfaces, possibly combined with charge transfer from the pillars to the nitride coating, decrease the range of the LIDT and increase the damage fluence. The surface-treated DLAs accelerate 97 keV electrons with an acceleration gradient of \$ 178 {\textbackslash}pm 1.8{\textbackslash};\{{\textbackslash}rm MeV/m\} \$178±1.8MeV/m, an increase of 11\% over the previous maximal gradient achieved with dual-pillar DLAs.},

	abstract = {Physics of structured waves is currently limited to relatively small particle energies as the available generation techniques are only applicable to the soft X-ray twisted photons, to the beams of electron microscopes, to cold neutrons, or non-relativistic atoms. The highly energetic vortex particles with an orbital angular momentum would come in handy for a number of experiments in atomic physics, nuclear, hadronic, and accelerator physics, and to generate them one needs to develop alternative methods, applicable for ultrarelativistic energies and for composite particles. Here, we show that the vortex states of in principle arbitrary particles can be generated during photon emission in helical undulators, via Cherenkov radiation, in collisions of charged particles with intense laser beams, in such scattering or annihilation processes as \$\$e{\textbackslash}mu {\textbackslash}rightarrow e{\textbackslash}mu , ep {\textbackslash}rightarrow ep, e{\textasciicircum}-e{\textasciicircum}+ {\textbackslash}rightarrow p{\textbackslash}bar\{p\}\$\$, and so forth. The key element in obtaining them is the postselection protocol due to entanglement between a pair of final particles and it is largely not the process itself. The state of a final particle – be it a \$\${\textbackslash}gamma \$\$-ray, a hadron, a nucleus, or an ion – becomes twisted if the azimuthal angle of the other particle momentum is measured with a large error or is not measured at all. As a result, requirements to the beam transverse coherence can be greatly relaxed, which enables the generation of highly energetic vortex beams at accelerators and synchrotron radiation facilities, thus making them a new tool for hadronic and spin studies.},

	abstract = {A wide variety of emission processes by electron wave packets with an orbital angular momentum ℓℏ, called the vortex electrons, can be influenced by a nonparaxial contribution due to their intrinsic electric quadrupole moment. We study Smith–Purcell radiation from a conducting grating generated by a vortex electron, described as a generalized Laguerre–Gaussian packet, which has an intrinsic magnetic dipole moment and an electric quadrupole moment. By using a multipole expansion of the electromagnetic field of such an electron, we employ a generalized surface-current method, applicable for a wide range of parameters. The radiated energy contains contributions from the charge, from the magnetic moment, and from the electric quadrupole moment, as well as from their interference. The quadrupole contribution grows as the packet spreads while propagating, and it is enhanced for large ℓ. In contrast to the linear growth of the radiation intensity from the charge with a number of strips N, the quadrupole contribution reveals an N 3 dependence, which puts a limit on the maximal grating length for which the radiation losses stay small. We study spectral-angular distributions of the Smith–Purcell radiation both analytically and numerically and demonstrate that the electron’s vorticity can give rise to detectable effects for non-relativistic and moderately relativistic electrons. On a practical side, preparing the incoming electron’s state in a form of a non-Gaussian packet with a quadrupole moment—such as the vortex electron, an Airy beam, a Schrödinger cat state, and so on—one can achieve quantum enhancement of the radiation power compared to the classical linear regime. Such an enhancement would be a hallmark of a previously unexplored quantum regime of radiation, in which non-Gaussianity of the packet influences the radiation properties much stronger than the quantum recoil.

In this work, we propose theoretically a new approach to realizing the Jaynes-Cummings model using low-energy free electrons coupled to dielectric microcavities and exemplify several quantum technologies made possible by this approach. Using quantum recoil, a large detuning inhibits the emission of multiple consecutive photons, effectively transforming the free electron into a few-level system coupled to the cavity mode. We show that this approach can be used for generation of single photons, photon pairs, and even a quantum SWAP gate between a photon and a free electron, with unity efficiency and high fidelity. Tunable by their kinetic energy, quantum free electrons are inherently versatile emitters with an engineerable emission wavelength. Hence, they pave the way toward new possibilities for quantum interconnects between photonic platforms at disparate spectral regimes. Free electrons coupled to optical cavities offer a way to realize the Jaynes-Cummings interaction.},

Event-based electron spectroscopy allows the spatial and spectral characterization of the electron ensemble emitted by each laser pulse. We identify distinctive energy and momentum correlations arising from acceleration-enhanced interparticle energy exchange, revealing strong few-body Coulomb interactions at an energy scale of 2 eV. State-sorted beam caustics show a discrete increase in virtual source size and longitudinal source shift for few-electron states, associated with transverse momentum correlations. We observe field-controllable electron antibunching, attributed primarily to transverse Coulomb deflection. The pronounced spatial and spectral characteristics of these electron number states allow filtering schemes that control the statistical distribution of the pulse charge. In this way, the fraction of specific few-electron states can be actively suppressed or enhanced, facilitating the preparation of highly non-Poissonian electron beams for microscopy and lithography, including future heralding schemes and correlated multi-electron probing.},

The question of how long a particle takes to tunnel through a potential barrier has sparked a long-standing debate since the early days of quantum mechanics. Here, we propose and demonstrate a novel scheme to accurately determine the tunneling time of an electron. In this scheme, a weak laser field is used to streak the tunneling current produced by a strong elliptically polarized laser field in an attoclock configuration, allowing us to retrieve the tunneling ionization time relative to the field maximum with a precision of a few attoseconds. This overcomes the difficulties in previous attoclock measurements wherein the Coulomb effect on the photoelectron momentum distribution has to be removed with theoretical models and it requires accurate information of the driving laser fields. We demonstrate that the tunneling time of an electron from an atom is close to zero within our experimental accuracy.

While these have been demonstrated for photons, carrying it over for electrons and the possibility of quantum electronic implementations has been challenging. Using two independent single-electron sources patterned into a two-dimensional electron gas, Bocquillon et al. (p. 1054, published online 24 January; see the Perspective by Schönenberger) performed single-electron interference experiments. The results demonstrate that the generated electrons can possess the desired properties for potential quantum applications. The interference of single electrons emitted from independent sources is demonstrated. [Also see Perspective by Schönenberger] The on-demand emission of coherent and indistinguishable electrons by independent synchronized sources is a challenging task of quantum electronics, in particular regarding its application for quantum information processing. Using two independent on-demand electron sources, we triggered the emission of two single-electron wave packets at different inputs of an electronic beam splitter. Whereas classical particles would be randomly partitioned by the splitter, we observed two-particle interference resulting from quantum exchange. Both electrons, emitted in indistinguishable wave packets with synchronized arrival time on the splitter, exited in different outputs as recorded by the low-frequency current noise. The demonstration of two-electron interference provides the possibility of manipulating coherent and indistinguishable single-electron wave packets in quantum conductors.},

Depending on the barrier transparency, the quantum emission time ranged from 0.1 to 10 nanoseconds. The single-electron source should prove useful for the use of quantum bits in ballistic conductors. Additionally, periodic sequences of single-electron emission and absorption generate a quantized alternating current.},

The acceleration gradient (or particle energy gain per unit length) is an important figure of merit. To design structures with high acceleration gradients, we explore the adjoint variable method, a highly efficient technique used to compute the sensitivity of an objective with respect to a large number of parameters. With this formalism, the sensitivity of the acceleration gradient of a dielectric structure with respect to its entire spatial permittivity distribution is calculated by the use of only two full-field electromagnetic simulations, the original and \&\#x02018;adjoint\&\#x02019;. The adjoint simulation corresponds physically to the reciprocal situation of a point charge moving through the accelerator gap and radiating. Using this formalism, we perform numerical optimizations aimed at maximizing acceleration gradients, which generate fabricable structures of greatly improved performance in comparison to previously examined geometries.},

For this purpose, we propose a photonic crystal architecture for a dielectric laser accelerator, referred to as a multi-input multi-output silicon accelerator (MIMOSA), that enables simultaneous acceleration of multiple electron beams, increasing the total electron throughput by at least 1 order of magnitude. To achieve this, we show that the photonic crystal must support a mode at the \&\#x0393; point in reciprocal space, with a normalized frequency equal to the normalized speed of the phase-matched electron. We show that the figure of merit of the MIMOSA can be inferred from the eigenmodes of the corresponding infinitely periodic structure, which provides a powerful approach to design such devices. Additionally, we extend the MIMOSA architecture to electron deflectors and other electron manipulation functionalities. These additional functionalities, combined with the increased electron throughput of these devices, permit all-optical on-chip manipulation of electron beams in a fully integrated architecture compatible with current fabrication technologies, which opens the way to unconventional electron beam shaping, imaging, and radiation generation.},

At high intensities, such as produced at free-electron lasers, nonlinearities can become important, and the probe may no longer be considered weak. Here we report the observation of one of the most fundamental nonlinear X-ray–matter interactions: the concerted nonlinear Compton scattering of two identical hard X-ray photons producing a single higher-energy photon. The X-ray intensity reached 4 × 1020 W cm−2, corresponding to an electric field well above the atomic unit of strength and within almost four orders of magnitude of the quantum-electrodynamic critical field. We measure a signal from solid beryllium that scales quadratically in intensity, consistent with simultaneous non-resonant two-photon scattering from nearly-free electrons. The high-energy photons show an anomalously large redshift that is incompatible with a free-electron approximation for the ground-state electron distribution, suggesting an enhanced nonlinearity for scattering at large momentum transfer.},

As a direct consequence, measurement sensitivities are fundamentally limited by quantization noise, or just ‘quantum noise’ in short. Furthermore, Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle demands measurement back-action for some observables of a system if they are measured repeatedly. In both respects, squeezed states are of high interest since they show a ‘squeezed’ uncertainty, which can be used to improve the sensitivity of measurement devices beyond the usual quantum noise limits including those impacted by quantum back-action noise. Squeezed states of light can be produced with nonlinear optics, and a large variety of proof-of-principle experiments were performed in past decades. As an actual application, squeezed light has now been used for several years to improve the measurement sensitivity of GEO 600 – a laser interferometer built for the detection of gravitational waves. Given this success, squeezed light is likely to significantly contribute to the new field of gravitational-wave astronomy. This Review revisits the concept of squeezed states and two-mode squeezed states of light, with a focus on experimental observations. The distinct properties of squeezed states displayed in quadrature phase-space as well as in the photon number representation are described. The role of the light’s quantum noise in laser interferometers is summarized and the actual application of squeezed states in these measurement devices is reviewed.},

However, the quantum nature of the electromagnetic fields is always present3. Here we demonstrate that intense laser–atom interactions may lead to the generation of highly non-classical light states. This was achieved by using the process of high-harmonic generation in atoms4,5, in which the photons of a driving laser pulse of infrared frequency are upconverted into photons of higher frequencies in the extreme ultraviolet spectral range. The quantum state of the fundamental mode after the interaction, when conditioned on the high-harmonic generation, is a so-called Schrödinger cat state, which corresponds to a superposition of two distinct coherent states: the initial state of the laser and the coherent state reduced in amplitude that results from the interaction with atoms. The results open the path for investigations towards the control of the non-classical states, exploiting conditioning approaches on physical processes relevant to high-harmonic generation.},

An ongoing challenge in all these is finding an efficient and controllable mechanism to entangle photons. Recent experimental developments in electron microscopy enable to control the quantum interaction between free electrons and light. Here, we show that free electrons can create entanglement and bunching of light. Free electrons can control the second-order coherence of initially independent photonic states, even in spatially separated cavities that cannot directly interact. Free electrons thus provide a type of optical nonlinearity that acts in a nonlocal manner, offering a way of heralding the creation of entanglement. Intriguingly, pre-shaping the electron’s wavefunction provides the knob for tuning the photonic quantum correlations. The concept can be generalized to entangle not only photons but also photonic quasiparticles such as plasmon-polaritons and phonons.},

These techniques would benefit tremendously from having a stable FEL source, generating spectrally pure and wavelength-tunable pulses. We show that such requirements can be met by operating the FEL in the so-called echo-enabled harmonic generation (EEHG) configuration. Here, two external conventional lasers are used to precisely tailor the longitudinal phase space of the electron beam before emission of X-rays. We demonstrate high-gain EEHG lasing producing stable, intense, nearly fully coherent pulses at wavelengths as short as 5.9 nm ({\textasciitilde}211 eV) at the FERMI FEL user facility. Low sensitivity to electron-beam imperfections and observation of stable, narrow-band, coherent emission down to 2.6 nm ({\textasciitilde}474 eV) make the technique a prime candidate for generating laser-like pulses in the X-ray spectral region, opening the door to multidimensional coherent spectroscopies at short wavelengths.},

	abstract = {Entangled photon pairs are a fundamental component for testing the foundations of quantum mechanics, and for modern quantum technologies such as teleportation and secured communication. Current state-of-the-art sources are based on nonlinear processes that are limited in their efficiency and wavelength tunability. This motivates the exploration of physical mechanisms for entangled photon generation, with a special interest in mechanisms that can be heralded, preferably at telecommunications wavelengths. Here we present a mechanism for the generation of heralded entangled photons from Rydberg atom cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity QED). We propose a scheme to demonstrate the mechanism and quantify its expected performance. The heralding of the process enables non-destructive detection of the photon pairs. The entangled photons are produced by exciting a rubidium atom to a Rydberg state, from where the atom decays via two-photon emission (TPE). A Rydberg blockade helps to excite a single Rydberg excitation while the input light field is more efficiently collectively absorbed by all the atoms. The TPE rate is significantly enhanced by a designed photonic cavity, whose many resonances also translate into high-dimensional entanglement. The resulting high-dimensionally entangled photons are entangled in more than one degree of freedom: in all of their spectral components, in addition to the polarization—forming a hyper-entangled state, which is particularly interesting in high information capacity quantum communication. We characterize the photon comb states by analyzing the Hong-Ou-Mandel interference and propose proof-of-concept experiments.},

The development of the latter was enabled by the emergence of single-photon-sensitive cameras that are able to characterize spatial correlations and high-dimensional entanglement. Thereby, new techniques emerged, such as ghost imaging of objects — in which the quantum correlations between photons reveal the image from photons that have never interacted with the object — or imaging with undetected photons by using nonlinear interferometers. In addition, quantum approaches in imaging can also lead to an improvement in the performance of conventional imaging systems. These improvements can be obtained by means of image contrast, resolution enhancement that exceeds the classical limit and acquisition of sub-shot-noise phase or amplitude images. In this Review, we discuss the application of quantum states of light for advanced imaging techniques.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in the development of electron and X-ray detectors have opened up the possibility to detect single events from which its time of arrival can be determined with nanosecond resolution. This allows observing time correlations between electrons and X-rays in the transmission electron microscope. In this work, a novel setup is described which measures individual events using a silicon drift detector and digital pulse processor for the X-rays and a Timepix3 detector for the electrons. This setup enables recording time correlation between both event streams while at the same time preserving the complete conventional electron energy loss (EELS) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) signal. We show that the added coincidence information improves the sensitivity for detecting trace elements in a matrix as compared to conventional EELS and EDX. Furthermore, the method allows the determination of the collection efficiencies without the use of a reference sample and can subtract the background signal for EELS and EDX without any prior knowledge of the background shape and without pre-edge fitting region. We discuss limitations in time resolution arising due to specificities of the silicon drift detector and discuss ways to further improve this aspect.},

	abstract = {As integrated circuits shrink in size, so does their nanocrystalline metal wiring. Defects at the interfaces between crystallites (grain boundaries) can degrade wires' electrical and thermal conductivity, as well as their longevity. Using scanning tunneling microscopy, Zhang et al. showed that the surfaces of nanocrystalline copper films are not flat but rather have ridges and valleys created by the grains rotating out of plane, which then introduces grain boundary defects. Such defects might be avoided if films of different orientations could be grown. Science, this issue p. 397 Scanning tunneling microscopy reveals ridges and valleys in films created by defects at grain boundaries. We used scanning tunneling microscopy to study low-angle grain boundaries at the surface of nearly planar copper nanocrystalline (111) films. The presence of grain boundaries and their emergence at the film surface create valleys composed of dissociated edge dislocations and ridges where partial dislocations have recombined. Geometric analysis and simulations indicated that valleys and ridges were created by an out-of-plane grain rotation driven by reduction of grain boundary energy. These results suggest that in general, it is impossible to form flat two-dimensional nanocrystalline films of copper and other metals exhibiting small stacking fault energies and/or large elastic anisotropy, which induce a large anisotropy in the dislocation-line energy.},

The development of wide-field quantum imaging to date has been hindered by low spatial resolutions, speeds, and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs). Here, we present quantum microscopy by coincidence (QMC) with balanced pathlengths, which enables super-resolution imaging at the Heisenberg limit with substantially higher speeds and CNRs than existing wide-field quantum imaging methods. QMC benefits from a configuration with balanced pathlengths, where a pair of entangled photons traversing symmetric paths with balanced optical pathlengths in two arms behave like a single photon with half the wavelength, leading to a two-fold resolution improvement. Concurrently, QMC resists stray light up to 155 times stronger than classical signals. The low intensity and entanglement features of biphotons in QMC promise nondestructive bioimaging. QMC advances quantum imaging to the microscopic level with significant improvements in speed and CNR toward the bioimaging of cancer cells. We experimentally and theoretically prove that the configuration with balanced pathlengths illuminates an avenue for quantum-enhanced coincidence imaging at the Heisenberg limit.},

The most exotic responses emerge at the exceptional point (EP) and in the broken PT-symmetry phase, yet in conventional PT-symmetric systems these regimes require large levels of gain and loss, posing remarkable challenges in practical settings. Floquet PT-symmetry, which may be realized by periodically flipping the effective gain/loss distribution in time, can relax these requirements and tailor the EP and PT-symmetry phases through the modulation period. Here, we explore Floquet PT-symmetry in an integrated photonic waveguide platform, in which the role of time is replaced by the propagation direction. We experimentally demonstrate spontaneous PT-symmetry breaking at small gain/loss levels and efficient control of amplification and suppression through the excitation ports. Our work introduces the advantages of Floquet PT-symmetry in a practical integrated photonic setting, enabling a powerful platform to observe PT-symmetric phenomena and leverage their extreme features, with applications in nanophotonics, coherent control of nanoscale light amplification and routing.},

The necessary requirements on the target parameters, the measuring instrumentation, and the experimental geometry are established. Variation of the X-ray radiation frequency depending on the angle of electron beam incidence on the target in the region of non-relativistic electron energies has been observed for the first time.

On the other hand, whispering gallery mode microresonators can serve as a highly efficient non-linear optical platform for producing light at different frequencies, that is, microcombs. Here we combine optical vortices and microcombs by demonstrating an optical vortex comb on a III–V integrated non-linear ring microresonator. The angular grating-dressed non-linear microring simultaneously emits spatiotemporal light springs consisting of 50 OAM modes, with each frequency of the microcomb carrying a distinct OAM value. We also experimentally generate optical pulses with time-varying OAM by carefully endowing the spatiotemporal light springs with a specific intermodal phase relation.

	abstract = {Flatbands have become a cornerstone of contemporary condensed-matter physics and photonics. In electronics, flatbands entail comparable energy bandwidth and Coulomb interaction, leading to correlated phenomena such as the fractional quantum Hall effect and recently those in magic-angle systems. In photonics, they enable properties including slow light1 and lasing2. Notably, flatbands support supercollimation—diffractionless wavepacket propagation—in both systems3,4. Despite these intense parallel efforts, flatbands have never been shown to affect the core interaction between free electrons and photons. Their interaction, pivotal for free-electron lasers5, microscopy and spectroscopy6,7, and particle accelerators8,9, is, in fact, limited by a dimensionality mismatch between localized electrons and extended photons. Here we reveal theoretically that photonic flatbands can overcome this mismatch and thus remarkably boost their interaction. We design flatband resonances in a silicon-on-insulator photonic crystal slab to control and enhance the associated free-electron radiation by tuning their trajectory and velocity. We observe signatures of flatband enhancement, recording a two-order increase from the conventional diffraction-enabled Smith–Purcell radiation. The enhancement enables polarization shaping of free-electron radiation and characterization of photonic bands through electron-beam measurements. Our results support the use of flatbands as test beds for strong light–electron interaction, particularly relevant for efficient and compact free-electron light sources and accelerators.},

	abstract = {Bremsstrahlung—the spontaneous emission of broadband radiation from free electrons that are deflected by atomic nuclei—contributes to the majority of X-rays emitted from X-ray tubes and used in applications ranging from medical imaging to semiconductor chip inspection. Here, we show that the bremsstrahlung intensity can be enhanced significantly—by more than three orders of magnitude—through shaping the electron wavefunction to periodically overlap with atoms in crystalline materials. Furthermore, we show how to shape the bremsstrahlung X-ray emission pattern into arbitrary angular emission profiles for purposes such as unidirectionality and multi-directionality. Importantly, we find that these enhancements and shaped emission profiles cannot be attributed solely to the spatial overlap between the electron probability distribution and the atomic centers, as predicted by the paraxial and non-recoil theory for free electron light emission. Our work highlights an unprecedented regime of free electron light emission where electron waveshaping provides multi-dimensional control over practical radiation processes like bremsstrahlung. Our results pave the way towards greater versatility in table-top X-ray sources and improved fundamental understanding of quantum electron-light interactions.},

	abstract = {Electron microscopes provide a powerful platform for exploring physical phenomena with nanoscale resolution, based on the interaction of free electrons with the excitations of a sample such as phonons, excitons, bulk plasmons, and surface plasmons. The interaction usually results in the absorption or emission of such excitations, which can be detected directly through cathodoluminescence or indirectly through electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). However, as we show here, the underlying interaction of a free electron and an arbitrary optical excitation goes beyond what was predicted or measured so far, due to the interplay of entanglement and decoherence of the electron-excitation system. The entanglement of electrons and optical excitations can provide new analytical tools in electron microscopy. For example, it can enable measurements of optical coherence, plasmonic lifetimes, and electronic length scales in matter (such as the Bohr radius of an exciton). We show how these can be achieved using common configurations in electron diffraction and EELS, revealing significant changes in the electron’s coherence, as well as in other quantum information theoretic measures such as purity. Specifically, we find that the purity after interaction with nanoparticles can only take discrete values, versus a continuum of values for interactions with surface plasmons. We quantify the post-interaction density matrix of the combined electron-excitation system by developing a framework based on macroscopic quantum electrodynamics. The framework enables a quantitative account of decoherence due to excitations in any general polarizable material (optical environment). This framework is thus applicable beyond electron microscopy. Particularly in electron microscopy, our work enriches analytical capabilities and informs the design of quantum information experiments with free electrons, allowing control over their quantum states and their decoherence by the optical environment.},

While intense laser light propagating in nonlinear crystals is conventionally used to generate entangled photons, such schemes have low efficiency due to the weak nonlinear response of known materials and losses associated with in/out photon coupling. Here, we show how to generate entangled polariton pairs directly within optical waveguides using free electrons. The measured energy loss of undeflected electrons heralds the production of counter-propagating polariton pairs entangled in energy and emission direction. For illustration, we study the excitation of plasmon polaritons in metal strip waveguides that strongly enhance light-matter interactions, rendering two-plasmon generation dominant over single-plasmon excitation. We demonstrate that electron energy losses detected within optimal frequency ranges can reliably signal the generation of plasmon pairs entangled in energy and momentum. Our proposed scheme is directly applicable to other types of optical waveguides for in situ generation of entangled photon pairs. Free electrons produce entangled polaritons with high efficiency.},

We introduce a mathematical scattering representation that inherently embeds fundamental principles of causality and passivity into its elemental degrees of freedom. We use this representation to reveal strong constraints in the mathematical structure of scattered fields, and to develop a general theory of the maximum radiative heat transfer in the near field, resolving a long-standing open question. Our approach can be seamlessly applied to high-interest applications across nanophotonics, and appears extensible to general classical and quantum scattering theory.},

We predict an optimum value of 0.4266, resulting in the maximum energy gain of 28.27 keV for an optical pulse energy of only 0.22 nJ and duration 1 ps. The acceleration gradient is 1.05\&\#x2005;GeV/m, which is lower than the maximum imposed by the damage threshold of Si waveguides. Our scheme shows how the coupling efficiency and energy gain can be maximized without maximizing the acceleration gradient.

	abstract = {When two electrons are emitted from a metal needle tip with the help of femtosecond laser pulses, they show a strong anticorrelation signal in the energy domain. Depending on the wavelength and intensity of the driving laser pulses, the electron emission process can be either in a perturbative regime, like single- or multi-photon photoemission, or in the strong-field regime, where emission is dominated by the instantaneous electric field of the laser pulse, or in the intermediate regime. Here, we report on the two-electron anticorrelation signal and how it evolves from the multiphoton toward the strong-field emission regime. We show that in both cases, the resulting anticorrelation signal can be well explained by semi-classical simulations using a point-particle model, thus the dynamics is dominated by the center-of-mass dynamics of the individual electrons. However, the actual emission process of multiple interacting electrons requires improved quantum mechanical models and therefore remains the subject of future work.

In this review, we discuss a nanoscale attosecond physics laboratory that has enabled the first observations of strong-field-driven photoemission and recollision at a solid surface: laser-triggered metallic nanotips. In addition to the research questions of rather fundamental nature, femtosecond electron sources with outstanding beam qualities have resulted from this research, which has prompted follow-up application in the sensing of electric fields and lightwave electronics, ultrafast microscopy and diffraction, and fundamental matter-wave quantum optics. We review the theoretical and experimental concepts underlying near-field enhancement, photoemission regimes and electron acceleration mechanisms. Nanotips add new degrees of freedom to well known strong-field phenomena from atomic physics. For example, they enable the realization of a true sub-optical-cycle acceleration regime where recollision is suppressed. We also discuss the possibility of high-harmonic generation due to laser irradiation of metallic nanostructures.},

In this article, we present measurements of electron number distributions from metal needle tips illuminated with ultrashort light pulses with various photon quantum statistics. By varying the photon statistics of the exciting light field between classical (Poissonian) and quantum (super-Poissonian), we demonstrate that the measured electron distributions are changed substantially. Using single-mode bright squeezed vacuum light, we measure extreme statistics events with up to 65 electrons from one light pulse at a mean of 0.27 electrons per pulse—the likelihood for such an event equals 10−128 with Poissonian statistics. By changing the number of modes of the exciting bright squeezed vacuum, we can tailor the electron number distribution on demand. Most importantly, our results demonstrate that the photon statistics is imprinted from the driving light to the emitted electrons, opening the door to new sensor devices and to strong-field optics with quantum light and electrons.},

	abstract = {Recently two emerging areas of research, attosecond and nanoscale physics, have started to come together. Attosecond physics deals with phenomena occurring when ultrashort laser pulses, with duration on the femto- and sub-femtosecond time scales, interact with atoms, molecules or solids. The laser-induced electron dynamics occurs natively on a timescale down to a few hundred or even tens of attoseconds (1 attosecond  =  1 as  =  10−18 s), which is comparable with the optical field. For comparison, the revolution of an electron on a 1s orbital of a hydrogen atom is  ∼152 as. On the other hand, the second branch involves the manipulation and engineering of mesoscopic systems, such as solids, metals and dielectrics, with nanometric precision. Although nano-engineering is a vast and well-established research field on its own, the merger with intense laser physics is relatively recent.  In this report on progress we present a comprehensive experimental and theoretical overview of physics that takes place when short and intense laser pulses interact with nanosystems, such as metallic and dielectric nanostructures. In particular we elucidate how the spatially inhomogeneous laser induced fields at a nanometer scale modify the laser-driven electron dynamics. Consequently, this has important impact on pivotal processes such as above-threshold ionization and high-order harmonic generation. The deep understanding of the coupled dynamics between these spatially inhomogeneous fields and matter configures a promising way to new avenues of research and applications. Thanks to the maturity that attosecond physics has reached, together with the tremendous advance in material engineering and manipulation techniques, the age of atto-nanophysics has begun, but it is in the initial stage. We present thus some of the open questions, challenges and prospects for experimental confirmation of theoretical predictions, as well as experiments aimed at characterizing the induced fields and the unique electron dynamics initiated by them with high temporal and spatial resolution.},

Individual pulses in this train carry information on ultrafast dynamics that vary from one half-optical-cycle to the next. Here, we demonstrate an all-optical photonic streaking measurement that provides direct experimental access to each attosecond pulse by mapping emission time onto propagation angle. This is achieved by inducing an ultrafast rotation of the instantaneous laser wavefront at the focus. We thus time-resolve attosecond pulse train generation, and hence the dynamics in the nonlinear medium itself. We apply photonic streaking to harmonic generation in gases and directly observe, for the first time, the influence of non-adiabatic electron dynamics and plasma formation on the generated attosecond pulse train. These experimental and numerical results also provide the first evidence of the generation of attosecond lighthouses in gases, which constitute ideal sources for attosecond pump–probe spectroscopy.},

	abstract = {Ultrafast electron pulses, combined with laser-pump and electron-probe technologies, allow ultrafast dynamics to be characterized in materials. However, the pursuit of simultaneous ultimate spatial and temporal resolution of microscopy and spectroscopy is largely subdued by the low monochromaticity of the electron pulses and their poor phase synchronization to the optical excitation pulses. Field-driven photoemission from metal tips provides high light-phase synchronization, but suffers large electron energy spreads (3?100 eV) as driven by a long wavelength laser ({\textgreater}800 nm). Here, ultrafast electron emission from carbon nanotubes (≈1 nm radius) excited by a 410 nm femtosecond laser is realized in the field-driven regime. In addition, the emitted electrons have great monochromaticity with energy spread as low as 0.25 eV. This great performance benefits from the extraordinarily high field enhancement and great stability of carbon nanotubes, superior to metal tips. The new nanotube-based ultrafast electron source opens exciting prospects for extending current characterization to sub-femtosecond temporal resolution as well as sub-nanometer spatial resolution.},

	abstract = {Quantum states of light play a key role in modern quantum science, but creating hybrid quantum light-matter states remains a challenge. A promising basis for the creation of hybrid states is the interaction of free electrons with photons, which has so far been largely implemented without taking into account electron quantum recoil effects. We provide an analytical quantum electrodynamics-based framework for quantum optics with recoiled electrons and introduce a single recoil parameter \${\textbackslash}sigma\$. With this framework, we show how to generate photon and electron-photon Bell, Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) and NOON states, coherent states, squeezed vacuum (including bright squeezed vacuum) and twin beams. We analyze the transition between these states and predict a new class of photon and electron-photon quantum states shaped with the photon recoil effect (recoil-induced shaping). These results have wide potential applications including quantum computing and communication with photons and free electrons, and open up a novel avenue for ultrafast electron microscopy and next-generation free-electron sources.},

	abstract = {Similar to the optical diffraction of light passing through a material grating, the Kapitza-Dirac effect occurs when an electron is diffracted by a standing light wave. In its original description, the effect is time independent. Here, we extended the Kapitza-Dirac effect to the time domain. By tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of a pulsed electron wave packet diffracted by a 60-femtosecond (where one femtosecond = 10
              −15
              seconds) standing wave pulse in a pump-probe scheme, we observed time-dependent diffraction patterns. The fringe spacing in the observed pattern differs from that generated by the conventional Kapitza-Dirac effect. By exploiting this time-resolved diffraction scheme, we can access the time evolution of the phase properties of a free electron and potentially image ionic potentials and electronic decoherences.

            Editor’s summary
            
              Diffraction of light from a matter grating stems from the wave property of electromagnetic radiation. Likewise, the wave properties of electrons prompted the proposal from Kapitza and Dirac in 1933 that electrons should be diffracted from a strong standing wave of light. Using an intense pulsed standing wave, Lin
              et al
              . added a temporal dimension when probing the evolution of a photoelectron wavepacket. Such phase sensitivity of the demonstrated dynamical Kapitza-Dirac effect should provide a valuable tool for ultrafast electron spectroscopy studies. —Ian S. Osborne

              Metamaterials (MMs) are smartly engineered structures with rationally designed, nanostructured building blocks that allow us to build devices with distinct responses to light, acoustic waves, and heat flows that are not attainable with naturally available materials.
            
            
              Advances
              The latest developments have shown that optical metasurfaces comprising a class of optical MMs with a reduced dimensionality can exhibit exceptional abilities for controlling the flow of light; achieve the anomalously large photonic density of states; and, similar to their bulk analog, provide superresolution imaging. Such a planar photonics technology is expected to facilitate new physics and enhanced functionality for devices that are distinctly different from those observed in their three-dimensional MM counterparts. As a result, this technology will enable new applications in imaging, sensing, data storage, quantum information processing, and light harvesting.
            
            
              Outlook
              The recent progress in optical metasurfaces can address the major issues hampering the full-scale development of MM technology, such as high loss, cost-ineffective fabrication, and challenging integration. The studies of new, low-loss, tunable plasmonic materials—such as transparent conducting oxides and intermetallics—that can be used as building blocks for metasurfaces will complement the exploration of smart designs and advanced switching capabilities. This progress in metasurface design and realization will lead to novel functionalities and improved performance and may result in the development of new types of ultrathin metasurface designs with unparalleled properties, including increased operational bandwidths and reduced losses. These new designs would also be compatible with planar, low-cost manufacturing. In turn, these advances will lead to ultrathin devices with unprecedented functionalities, ranging from dynamic spatial light modulation to pulse shaping and from subwavelength imaging or sensing to novel quantum optics devices.

            A Move to Planar Optics
            
              Metamaterials allow light to be manipulated in ways that cannot be done with naturally available materials. Subwavelength metallic nanoantenna arrays patterned onto a surface can provide the basis for planar optical devices, in which bulk optical elements that are typically thousands of wavelengths in size can be "flattened" into a two-dimensional sheet less than a wavelength thick.

            Metamaterials, or engineered materials with rationally designed, subwavelength-scale building blocks, allow us to control the behavior of physical fields in optical, microwave, radio, acoustic, heat transfer, and other applications with flexibility and performance that are unattainable with naturally available materials. In turn, metasurfaces—planar, ultrathin metamaterials—extend these capabilities even further. Optical metasurfaces offer the fascinating possibility of controlling light with surface-confined, flat components. In the planar photonics concept, it is the reduced dimensionality of the optical metasurfaces that enables new physics and, therefore, leads to functionalities and applications that are distinctly different from those achievable with bulk, multilayer metamaterials. Here, we review the progress in developing optical metasurfaces that has occurred over the past few years with an eye toward the promising future directions in the field.},

            Conventional optical components rely on gradual phase shifts accumulated during light propagation to shape light beams. New degrees of freedom are attained by introducing abrupt phase changes over the scale of the wavelength. A two-dimensional array of optical resonators with spatially varying phase response and subwavelength separation can imprint such phase discontinuities on propagating light as it traverses the interface between two media. Anomalous reflection and refraction phenomena are observed in this regime in optically thin arrays of metallic antennas on silicon with a linear phase variation along the interface, which are in excellent agreement with generalized laws derived from Fermat’s principle. Phase discontinuities provide great flexibility in the design of light beams, as illustrated by the generation of optical vortices through use of planar designer metallic interfaces.},

In most cases, correlations in electrons arise exclusively because of Coulomb interactions. In this work, we reveal that free electrons interacting simultaneously with a light field can become highly correlated via mechanisms beyond Coulomb interactions. In the case of two electrons, the resulting Pearson correlation coefficient for the joint probability distribution of the output electron energies is enhanced by more than 13 orders of magnitude compared to that of electrons interacting with the light field in succession (one after another). These highly correlated electrons are the result of momentum and energy exchange between the participating electrons via the external quantum light field. Our findings pave the way to the creation and control of highly correlated free electrons for applications including quantum information and ultrafast imaging.

The main obstacles to achieving this real-time view of a chemical reaction are associated with delivering short electron pulses with sufficient electron density to the sample. In this article, the propagation dynamics of femtosecond electron packets in the drift region of a photoelectron gun are investigated with an N-body numerical simulation and mean-field model. It is found that space-charge effects can broaden the electron pulse to many times its original length and generate many eV of kinetic energy bandwidth in only a few nanoseconds. There is excellent agreement between the N-body simulation and the mean-field model for both space-charge induced temporal and kinetic energy distribution broadening. The numerical simulation also shows that the redistribution of electrons inside the packet results in changes to the pulse envelope and the development of a spatially linear axial velocity distribution. These results are important for (or have the potential to impact on) the interpretation of time-resolved electron diffraction experiments and can be used in the design of photoelectron guns and streak tubes with temporal resolution of several hundred femtoseconds.},

            Recent advances in the physics and technology of light generation via free-electron proximity and impact interactions with nanostructures (gratings, photonic crystals, nano-undulators, metamaterials and antenna arrays) have enabled the development of nanoscale-resolution techniques for such applications as mapping plasmons, studying nanoparticle structural transformations and characterizing luminescent materials (including time-resolved measurements). Here, we introduce a universal approach allowing generation of light with prescribed wavelength, direction, divergence and topological charge via point-excitation of holographic plasmonic metasurfaces. It is illustrated using medium-energy free-electron injection to generate highly-directional visible to near-infrared light beams, at selected wavelengths in prescribed azimuthal and polar directions, with brightness two orders of magnitude higher than that from an unstructured surface, and vortex beams with topological charge up to ten. Such emitters, with micron-scale dimensions and the freedom to fully control radiation parameters, offer novel applications in nano-spectroscopy, nano-chemistry and sensing.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Free‐electron radiation is a fundamental photon emission process that is induced by fast‐moving electrons interacting with optical media. Historically, it has been understood that, just like any other photon emission process, free‐electron radiation must be constrained within a finite time interval known as the “formation time,” whose concept is applicable to both Cherenkov radiation and transition radiation, the two basic mechanisms describing radiation from a bulk medium and from an interface, respectively. Here, this work reveals an alternative mechanism of free‐electron radiation far beyond the previously defined formation time. It occurs when a fast electron crosses the interface between vacuum and a plasmonic medium supporting bulk plasmons. While emitted continuously from the crossing point on the interface—thus consistent with the features of transition radiation—the extra radiation beyond the conventional formation time is supported by a long tail of bulk plasmons following the electron's trajectory deep into the plasmonic medium. Such a plasmonic tail mixes surface and bulk effects, and provides a sustained channel for electron–interface interaction. These results also settle the historical debate in Ferrell radiation, regarding whether it is a surface or bulk effect, from transition radiation or plasmonic oscillation.},

              Skyrmions are stable topological textures that arise from solutions of the electromagnetic field. Because these “hedgehog”-like textures are robust, can be manipulated, and can interact, there is an interest in pursuing them for memory and logic applications. Skyrmions can also be generated in thin metal layers under optical excitation, but detailed information about the vectorial dynamics of these surface plasmon polariton skyrmions is so far lacking.

              INTRODUCTION
              Topology is the study of geometric properties that are unaffected by continuous changes in shape and size. Skyrmions are examples of topological defects in vector fields. Skyrmions exhibit a characteristic vector structure. When excited by electromagnetic near fields on thin metal films, they are called plasmonic skyrmions. These fields exist at sub–100-nm scales and oscillate with periods of a few femtoseconds and thus are difficult to measure.
            
            
              RATIONALE
              Two-photon photoemission electron microscopy studies were previously able to image the local plasmon fields with femtosecond time resolution, but the vector information of the local electric fields was missing. Here we introduce a new technique, time-resolved vector microscopy, that enables us to compose entire movies on a subfemtosecond time scale and a 10-nm spatial scale of the electric field vectors of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs). We use this technique to image complete time sequences of propagating surface plasmons, demonstrating their spin-momentum locking, as well as plasmonic skyrmions on atomically flat single-crystalline gold films that have been patterned using gold ion beam lithography.
            
            
              RESULTS
              The key technique to obtain vector information is to take two sequences of the entire process with two different probe beam polarizations. Hence, the electric field vectors will be projected onto the probing electric field by the two-photon photoemission process. The spatial dependence of the two in-plane vector components coupled with Maxwell’s equations then permits the retrieval of the out-of-plane component. This allows us to unambiguously resolve all vector components of the electric field as well as their time dynamics, enabling the retrieval of the experimental time-dependent skyrmion number and indicating the periodic transformation from skyrmion number +1 to −1 and back on a time scale of a few femtoseconds. Additionally, all three magnetic field vectors of the surface can be obtained from the electric field vectors by using Maxwell’s curl equation.
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              With our vector microscopy technique, we are able to image plasmonic spin-momentum locking and plasmonic skyrmion dynamics. In the future, other topological nanophotonic systems should be in reach as well; these include plasmonic merons or short-range skyrmions, where the dispersion of plasmons in extremely thin films is used. This research will open the door to creating linear optical features on the few-nanometer length scale.
              
                
                  Ultrafast time-resolved vector microscopy of plasmonic skyrmions.
                  
                    Femtosecond laser pump-probe techniques using polarized beams combined with two-photon electron emission in an electron microscope enables the retrieval of all vector components of the electric field of propagating SPPs as a function of time. We used this technique to image the vectorial time dynamics of the plasmonic skyrmion field. Hexagons are milled into single-crystalline gold flakes via ion beam lithography. A circularly polarized femtosecond laser pulse excites surface plasmon waves on the gold flakes that interfere to create an SPP skyrmion lattice. The SPPs are detected by interference with a second laser pulse that is first polarized in the
                    x
                    direction to retrieve the

                    component of the SPP wave and then is polarized in the
                    y
                    direction to produce the

                    component. These fields are combined to obtain the characteristic in-plane pattern of the skyrmion lattice:

                    . Use of the measured field components in Maxwell’s equations enables the vertical field component

From these data, we reconstruct the vector field of the SPP skyrmion and, by varying the laser pump-probe delay time (Δτ), gain time-resolved information (top right), allowing us to create vector movies that show plasmonic spin-momentum locking and plasmonic skyrmions (bottom right).

            Plasmonic skyrmions are an optical manifestation of topological defects in a continuous vector field. Identifying them requires characterization of the vector structure of the electromagnetic near field on thin metal films. Here we introduce time-resolved vector microscopy that creates movies of the electric field vectors of surface plasmons with subfemtosecond time steps and a 10-nanometer spatial scale. We image complete time sequences of propagating surface plasmons as well as plasmonic skyrmions, resolving all vector components of the electric field and their time dynamics, thus demonstrating dynamic spin-momentum coupling as well as the time-varying skyrmion number. The ability to image linear optical effects in the spin and phase structures of light in the single-nanometer range will allow for entirely novel microscopy and metrology applications.},

            Time-resolved electron microscopy aims to track nanoscale excitations and dynamic states of matter at a temporal resolution ultimately reaching the attosecond regime. Periodically time-varying fields in an illuminated specimen cause free-electron inelastic scattering, which enables the spectroscopic imaging of near-field intensities. However, access to the evolution of nanoscale fields and structures within the cycle of light requires sensitivity to the optical phase. Here we introduce free-electron homodyne detection as a universally applicable approach to electron microscopy of phase-resolved optical responses at high spatiotemporal resolution. In this scheme, a phase-controlled reference interaction serves as the local oscillator to extract arbitrary sample-induced modulations of a free-electron wavefunction. We demonstrate this principle through the phase-resolved imaging of plasmonic fields with few-nanometre spatial and sub-cycle temporal resolutions. Due to its sensitivity to both phase- and amplitude-modulated electron beams, free-electron homodyne detection measurements will be able to detect and amplify weak signals stemming from a wide variety of microscopic origins, including linear and nonlinear optical polarizations, atomic and molecular resonances, and attosecond-modulated structure factors.},

Here, we leverage the nonlinear, overconstrained nature of PINEM to present an algorithmic microscopy approach, achieving far superior nearfield imaging capabilities. Our algorithm relies on free-electron Ramsey-type interferometry to produce orders-of-magnitude improvement in sensitivity and ambiguity-immune nearfield phase reconstruction, both of which are optimal when the electron exhibits a fully quantum behavior. Our results demonstrate the potential of combining algorithmic approaches with state-of-the-art modalities in electron microscopy and may lead to various applications from imaging sensitive biological samples to performing full-field tomography of confined light.

We provide a simultaneous time-, space-, and phase-resolved measurement in a micro-drum made from a hexagonal boron nitride membrane, visualizing the sub-cycle spatio-temporal dynamics of 2D polariton wavepackets therein.

              INTRODUCTION
              Bombardment of materials by high-energy particles often leads to light emission in a process known as scintillation. Scintillators, being broadly applicable to the detection of ionizing radiation, have widespread applications, including in x-ray detectors for medical imaging and nondestructive inspection, gamma-ray detectors for positron emission tomography, phosphor screens in night vision systems and electron microscopes, and electromagnetic calorimeters in high-energy physics experiments. Accordingly, there is great interest in the development of “better scintillators” with greater photon yields and improved spatial and energy resolution. Better scintillators in general would lead to definite improvements in all of the above use cases. One example application is medical imaging, where brighter scintillators could enable very-low-dose x-ray imaging, therefore reducing potential harm to patients. Most research into the problem of improving scintillators involves the synthesis of new materials with better intrinsic scintillating properties.
            
            
              RATIONALE
              The conversion of a high-energy particle into photons is a complex, multiphysics process in which the incident particle creates a cascade of secondary electron excitations in the scintillator. These secondary excitations then relax into a non-equilibrium distribution before emitting scintillation photons. By creating spatial inhomogeneities in the scintillator on the scale of the scintillation photon wavelength, and thus modulating the optical properties of the material on the wavelength scale, one can control and enhance the light emission. In such “nanophotonic scintillators,” it is then possible for the light-emitting electrons in the scintillator to emit light much more rapidly due to enhancement of the local density of optical states available to the electrons for light emission. It is also possible to use these nanophotonic structures to “steer” trapped light out of the scintillator, enabling more light to be detected. Both of these effects lead to enhanced rates of scintillation photon emission. These nanophotonic effects are material-agnostic, enabling in principle any scintillator to be enhanced, and these effects can also be in principle observed for any type of high-energy particle.
            
            
              RESULTS
              We developed a first-principles theory of nanophotonic scintillators, taking into account the complex processes leading to electron excitation as well as the light emission by non-equilibrium electrons in arbitrary nanophotonic structures. Using the theory as a guide, we experimentally demonstrated order-of-magnitude scintillation enhancements in two different platforms: electron-induced scintillation by silica defects, and x-ray–induced scintillation by rare-earth dopants in conventional scintillators. The enhancements in both cases were enabled by two-dimensionally periodic etching of either the scintillator or the material above the scintillator to create a two-dimensional photonic crystal slab geometry. The theory accounted for the enhancements observed experimentally, as well as other effects that required first-principles description of the underlying microscopic kinetics of the emission process. For example, we could explain the observed spectral shaping as a function of geometrical parameters of the photonic crystal slab. Additionally, using the framework, we could account for nonlinear relationships of the signal on the incident particle flux, as well as effects where the dominant scintillation wavelength could change as a function of high-energy particle flux. Beyond, we used a nanopatterned x-ray scintillator to record x-ray scans of various specimens and observed an increase in image brightness. This directly translates into faster scans, or equivalently a lower x-ray dose required to achieve a given brightness.
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              Our framework can be directly applied to model nanophotonic scintillation in many existing experiments, accounting for arbitrary types of high-energy particles, scintillator materials, and nanophotonic environments. Beyond this, our framework also allows the discovery of optimal nanophotonic structures for enhancing scintillation. We show how topology optimization and other types of nanophotonic structures can be used to find structures that could present even larger scintillation enhancements. We expect that the concept demonstrated here could be deployed in all of the application areas where scintillators are used, with compelling applications throughout, including medical imaging, night vision, and high-energy physics experiments.

              Converting ionizing radiation into visible light is essential in a wide range of fundamental and industrial applications, such as electromagnetic calorimeters in high‐energy particle detectors, electron detectors, image intensifiers, and X‐ray imaging. These different areas of technology all rely on scintillators or phosphors, i.e., materials that emit light upon bombardment by high‐energy particles. In all cases, the emission is through
              spontaneous emission
              . The fundamental nature of spontaneous emission poses limitations on all these technologies, imposing an intrinsic
              trade‐off
              between efficiency and resolution in all imaging applications: thicker phosphors are more efficient due to their greater stopping power, which however comes at the expense of image blurring due to light spread inside the thicker phosphors. Here, the concept of inverse‐designed nanophotonic scintillators is proposed, which can overcome the trade‐off between resolution and efficiency by reshaping the intrinsic spontaneous emission. To exemplify the concept, multilayer phosphor nanostructures are designed and these nanostructures are compared to state‐of‐the‐art phosphor screens in image intensifiers, showing a threefold resolution enhancement simultaneous with a threefold efficiency enhancement. The enabling concept is applying the ubiquitous Purcell effect for the first time in a new context—for improving image resolution. Looking forward, this approach directly applies to a wide range of technologies, including X‐ray imaging applications.},

This triggered great efforts to create far-UVC light sources with sufficient emission power and efficiency. However, current sources, such as mercury lamps, KrCl excimer lamps, and LEDs, are made from hazardous chemicals or are limited by low efficiency. Consequently, an alternative approach for reaching the far-UVC is now receiving renewed interest: using phosphors for converting higher frequencies to the desired range of far-UVC. However, this concept is limited by the phosphor's conversion efficiency. In this paper, we propose to utilize principles of nanophotonics to create far-UVC sources. Specifically, we design a phosphor-dielectric multilayer that increases the efficiency of far-UVC light conversion and controls the intrinsic emission properties, including the angular spectrum and emission rate, by shaping the local density of photonic states. To exemplify our approach, we design an aperiodic multilayer nanostructure made of the phosphor material YPO4:Pr3+, showing an increase in light extraction by a factor of 3 compared to naïve bulk structures. Our approach can be applied to any phosphor material and any emitter geometry, opening avenues for engineering nanophotonic light sources in the far-UVC and other spectral regimes.},

            The development of X‐ray scintillators with ultrahigh light yields and ultrafast response times is a long sought‐after goal. In this work, a fundamental mechanism that pushes the frontiers of ultrafast X‐ray scintillator performance is theoretically predicted and experimentally demonstrated: the use of nanoscale‐confined surface plasmon polariton modes to tailor the scintillator response time via the Purcell effect. By incorporating nanoplasmonic materials in scintillator devices, this work predicts over tenfold enhancement in decay rate and 38\% reduction in time resolution even with only a simple planar design. The nanoplasmonic Purcell effect is experimentally demonstrated using perovskite scintillators, enhancing the light yield by over 120\% to 88 ± 11 ph/keV, and the decay rate by over 60\% to 2.0 ± 0.2 ns for the average decay time, and 0.7 ± 0.1 ns for the ultrafast decay component, in good agreement with the predictions of our theoretical framework. Proof‐of‐concept X‐ray imaging experiments are performed using nanoplasmonic scintillators, demonstrating 182\% enhancement in the modulation transfer function at four line pairs per millimeter spatial frequency. This work highlights the enormous potential of nanoplasmonics in optimizing ultrafast scintillator devices for applications including time‐of‐flight X‐ray imaging and photon‐counting computed tomography.},

Here, we experimentally demonstrate a fundamentally different, recently proposed concept for enhancing the scintillation rate and yield: the Purcell effect. The Purcell effect is a universal enhancement mechanism for spontaneous emission by engineering the optical environment. In scintillators, such an enhancement arises from engineering the nanoscale geometry within the scintillation bulk, which thus applies universally to any scintillating material and dopant. We design and fabricate a thin multilayer nanophotonic scintillator, demonstrating Purcell-enhanced scintillation, achieving a 50\% enhancement in emission-rate and an 80\% enhancement in light yield. We demonstrate the potential of our device for realizing these enhancements in real-life settings for X-ray applications, also due to the robustness of the nanophotonic design to fabrication disorder. Our results show the bright prospects of bridging nanophotonics and scintillators science, toward reduced radiation dosage and increased resolution for high-energy particles detection.},

              Faraday rotation is a fundamental effect in the magneto-optical response of solids, liquids and gases. Materials with a large Verdet constant find applications in optical modulators, sensors and non-reciprocal devices, such as optical isolators. Here, we demonstrate that the plane of polarization of light exhibits a giant Faraday rotation of several degrees around the A exciton transition in hBN-encapsulated monolayers of WSe
              2
              and MoSe
              2
              under moderate magnetic fields. This results in the highest known Verdet constant of -1.9 × 10
              7
               deg T
              −1
               cm
              −1
              for any material in the visible regime. Additionally, interlayer excitons in hBN-encapsulated bilayer MoS
              2
              exhibit a large Verdet constant (
              V

              ≈ +2 × 10

               cm
              −2
              ) of opposite sign compared to A excitons in monolayers. The giant Faraday rotation is due to the giant oscillator strength and high
              g
              -factor of the excitons in atomically thin semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides. We deduce the complete in-plane complex dielectric tensor of hBN-encapsulated WSe

              and MoSe
              2
              monolayers, which is vital for the prediction of Kerr, Faraday and magneto-circular dichroism spectra of 2D heterostructures. Our results pose a crucial advance in the potential usage of two-dimensional materials in ultrathin optical polarization devices.},

              Cherenkov radiation (CR) from electrons propagating in materials with a high refractive index have applications in particle-detection mechanisms and could be used for high-yield coherent electron beam-driven photon sources. However, the theory of the CR has been treated up to now using the non-recoil approximation, which neglects the effect of electron deceleration in materials. Here, we report on the effect of electron-beam deceleration on the radiated spectrum and exciton-photon interactions in nm-thick WSe
              2
              crystals. The calculation of the CR is performed by simulating the kinetic energy of an electron propagating in a thick sample using the Monto Carlo method combined with the Lienard–Wiechert retarded potential. Using this approach, we numerically investigate the interaction between the excitons and generated photons (CR) beyond the non-recoil approximation and are able to reproduce experimental cathodoluminescence spectra. Our findings pave the way for an accurate design of particle scintillators and detectors, based on the strong-coupling phenomenon.},

            Inelastic interaction of free-electrons with optical near fields has recently attracted attention for manipulating and shaping free-electron wavepackets. Understanding the nature and the dependence of the inelastic cross section on the polarization of the optical near-field is important for both fundamental aspects and the development of new applications in quantum-sensitive measurements. Here, we investigate the effect of the polarization and the spatial profile of plasmonic near-field distributions on shaping free-electrons and controlling the energy transfer mechanisms, but also tailoring the electron recoil. We particularly show that polarization of the exciting light can be used as a control knop for disseminating the acceleration and deceleration path ways via the experienced electron recoil. We also demonstrate the possibility of tailoring the shape of the localized plasmons by incorporating specific arrangements of nanorods to enhance or hamper the transversal and longitudinal recoils of free-electrons. Our findings open up a route towards plasmonic near-fields-engineering for the coherent manipulation and control of slow electron beams for creating desired shapes of electron wavepackets.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Strongly correlated solids are complex and fascinating quantum systems, where new electronic states continue to emerge, especially when interaction with light triggers interplay between them. In this interplay, a sub-laser-cycle electronic response is particularly attractive as a tool for the ultrafast manipulation of matter at the petahertz scale. Here we introduce a new type of nonlinear multidimensional spectroscopy, which allows us to unravel charge and energy flows in strongly correlated systems interacting with few-cycle infrared pulses and the complex interplay between different correlated states evolving on the sub-femtosecond timescale. We demonstrate that the sub-cycle spectroscopy of a single-particle electronic response is extremely sensitive to correlated many-body dynamics and provides direct access to many-body response functions. For the two-dimensional Hubbard model under the influence of ultrashort, intense electric-field transients, we resolve the sub-femtosecond pathways of charge and energy flows between localized and delocalized many-body states and the creation of a highly correlated state surviving after the end of the laser pulse. Our findings open the way towards a regime of imaging and manipulating strongly correlated materials at optical rates, beyond the multicycle approach employed in Floquet engineering, with the sub-cycle response being a key tool for accessing many-body phenomena.},

	abstract = {For decades, most research of high harmonic generation (HHG) considered matter as quantum but light as classical. Recently, HHG driven by quantum states of light such as bright squeezed vacuum was predicted to reach beyond the classical HHG cutoff. Moreover, in squeezed coherent illumination, it was shown that the underlying dynamics are significantly modified by the photon statistics effective force. Here we show that HHG driven by quantum light results in quantum high harmonics. We derive a formula for the quantum state of the high harmonics, when driven by arbitrary quantum light states, and then explore specific cases of experimental relevance. Specifically, for a moderately squeezed pump, HHG driven by squeezed coherent light results in squeezed high harmonics. Harmonic squeezing is optimized by syncing ionization times with the pump's squeezing phase. Beyond this regime, as pump squeezing is increased, the harmonics initially acquire squeezed thermal photon statistics, and then occupy an intricate quantum state which strongly depends on the semiclassical nonlinear response function of the interacting system. Our results pave the way for generation of squeezed extreme-ultraviolet ultrashort pulses, and more generally, quantum frequency conversion into previously inaccessible spectral ranges, which may enable ultrasensitive attosecond metrology.

Advanced beam control facilitates new functionalities. Here, we report the guiding and splitting of charged particle beams using ponderomotive forces created by the motion of charged particles through electrostatic optics printed on planar substrates. Shape and strength of the potential can be locally tailored by the lithographically produced electrodes’ layout and the applied voltages, enabling the control of charged particle beams within precisely engineered effective potentials. We demonstrate guiding of electrons and ions for a large range of energies (from 20 to 5000 eV) and masses (from 5 · 10

            Electron waves that carry orbital angular momentum (OAM) are characterized by a quantized and unbounded magnetic dipole moment parallel to their propagation direction. When interacting with magnetic materials, the wavefunctions of such electrons are inherently modified. Such variations therefore motivate the need to analyse electron wavefunctions, especially their wavefronts, to obtain information regarding the material’s structure. Here, we propose, design and demonstrate the performance of a device based on nanoscale holograms for measuring an electron’s OAM components by spatially separating them. We sort pure and superposed OAM states of electrons with OAM values of between −10 and 10. We employ the device to analyse the OAM spectrum of electrons that have been affected by a micron-scale magnetic dipole, thus establishing that our sorter can be an instrument for nanoscale magnetic spectroscopy.},

            Ultrafast photon–electron spectroscopy in electron microscopes commonly requires ultrafast laser setups. Photoemission from an engineered electron source is used to generate pulsed electrons, interacting with a sample excited by the laser pulse at a known time delay. Thus, developing an ultrafast electron microscope demands the exploitation of extrinsic laser excitations and complex synchronization schemes. Here we present an inverse approach to introduce internal radiation sources in an electron microscope based on cathodoluminescence spectroscopy. Our compact method is based on a sequential interaction of the electron beam with an electron-driven photon source and the investigated sample. Such a source in an electron microscope generates phase-locked photons that are mutually coherent with the near-field distribution of the swift electron. We confirm the mutual frequency and momentum-dependent correlation of the electron-driven photon source and sample radiation and determine a degree of mutual coherence of up to 27\%. With this level of mutual coherence, we were able to perform spectral interferometry with an electron microscope. Our method has the advantage of being simple, compact and operating with continuous electron beams. It will open the door to local photon–electron correlation spectroscopy of quantum materials, single-photon systems and coherent exciton–polaritonic samples with nanometre resolution.},

            In electron microscopy, detailed insights into nanoscale optical properties of materials are gained by spontaneous inelastic scattering leading to electron-energy loss and cathodoluminescence. Stimulated scattering in the presence of external sample excitation allows for mode- and polarization-selective photon-induced near-field electron microscopy (PINEM). This process imprints a spatial phase profile inherited from the optical fields onto the wave function of the probing electrons. Here, we introduce Lorentz-PINEM for the full-field, non-invasive imaging of complex optical near fields at high spatial resolution. We use energy-filtered defocus phase-contrast imaging and iterative phase retrieval to reconstruct the phase distribution of interfering surface-bound modes on a plasmonic nanotip. Our approach is universally applicable to retrieve the spatially varying phase of nanoscale fields and topological modes.},

	abstract = {Since the birth of quantum optics, the measurement of quantum states of nonclassical light has been of tremendous importance for advancement in the field. To date, conventional detectors such as photomultipliers, avalanche photodiodes, and superconducting nanowires, all rely at their core on linear excitation of bound electrons with light, posing fundamental restrictions on the detection. In contrast, the interaction of free electrons with light in the context of quantum optics is highly nonlinear and offers exciting possibilities. The first experiments that promoted this direction appeared over the past decade as part of photon-induced nearfield electron microscopy (PINEM), wherein free electrons are capable of high-order multi-photon absorption and emission. Here we propose using free electrons for quantum-optical detection of the complete quantum state of light. We show how the precise control of the electron before and after its interaction with quantum light enables to extract the photon statistics and implement full quantum state tomography using PINEM. This technique can reach sub-attosecond time resolutions, measure temporal coherence of any degree (e.g., g(1), g(2)), and simultaneously detect large numbers of photons with each electron. Importantly, the interaction of the electron with light is non-destructive, thereby leaving the photonic state (modified by the interaction) intact, which is conceptually different from conventional detectors. By using a pulse of multiple electrons, we envision how PINEM quantum detectors could achieve a single-shot measurement of the complete state of quantum light, even for non-reproducible emission events. Altogether, our work paves the way to novel kinds of photodetectors that utilize the ultrafast duration, high nonlinearity, and non-destructive nature of electron-light interactions.},

            Recent years have seen a growing interest in strong coupling between plasmons and excitons, as a way to generate new quantum optical testbeds and influence chemical dynamics and reactivity. Strong coupling to bright plasmonic modes has been achieved even with single quantum emitters. Dark plasmonic modes fare better in some applications due to longer lifetimes, but are difficult to probe as they are subradiant. Here, we apply electron energy loss (EEL) spectroscopy to demonstrate that a dark mode of an individual plasmonic bowtie can interact with a small number of quantum emitters, as evidenced by Rabi-split spectra. Coupling strengths of up to 85 meV place the bowtie-emitter devices at the onset of the strong coupling regime. Remarkably, the coupling occurs at the periphery of the bowtie gaps, even while the electron beam probes their center. Our findings pave the way for using EEL spectroscopy to study exciton-plasmon interactions involving non-emissive photonic modes.},

            Thanks to their exceptional spatial, spectral and temporal resolution, highly-coherent free-electron beams have emerged as powerful probes for material excitations, enabling their characterization even in the quantum regime. Here, we investigate strong light–matter coupling through monochromatic and modulated electron wavepackets. In particular, we consider an archetypal target, comprising a nanophotonic cavity next to a single two-level emitter. We propose a model Hamiltonian describing the coherent interaction between the passing electron beam and the hybrid photonic–excitonic target, which is constructed using macroscopic quantum electrodynamics and fully parameterized in terms of the electromagnetic dyadic Green’s function. Using this framework, we first describe electron-energy-loss and cathodoluminescence spectroscopies, and photon-induced near-field electron emission microscopy. Finally, we show the power of modulated electrons beams as quantum tools for the manipulation of polaritonic targets presenting a complex energy landscape of excitations.},

              The generation of nonclassical light states bears a paramount importance in quantum optics and is largely relying on the interaction between intense laser pulses and nonlinear media. Recently, electron beams, such as those used in ultrafast electron microscopy to retrieve information from a specimen, have been proposed as a tool to manipulate both bright and dark confined optical excitations, inducing semiclassical states of light that range from coherent to thermal mixtures. Here, we show that the ponderomotive contribution to the electron–cavity interaction, which we argue to be significant for low-energy electrons subject to strongly confined near-fields, can actually create a more general set of optical states, including coherent and squeezed states. The postinteraction electron spectrum further reveals signatures of the nontrivial role played by

	abstract = {Spontaneous light emission is central to a vast range of physical systems and is a founding pillar for the theory of light–matter interactions. In the presence of complex photonic media, the description of spontaneous light emission usually requires advanced theoretical quantum optics tools such as macroscopic quantum electrodynamics, involving quantized electromagnetic fields. Although rigorous and comprehensive, the complexity of such models can obscure the intuitive understanding of many quantum-optical phenomena. Here, we review a method for calculating spontaneous emission and other quantum-optical processes without making explicit use of quantized electromagnetic fields. Instead, we introduce the concept of transition currents, comprising charges in matter that undergo transitions between initial and final quantum states. We show how predictions that usually demand advanced methods in quantum electrodynamics or quantum optics can be reproduced by feeding these transition currents as sources to the classical Maxwell equations. One then obtains the relevant quantum observables from the resulting classical field amplitudes, without washing out quantum optical effects. We show that this procedure allows for a straightforward description of quantum phenomena, even when going beyond the dipole approximation and single emitters. As illustrative examples, we calculate emission patterns and Purcell-enhanced emission rates in both bound-electron and free-electron systems. For the latter, we derive cathodoluminescence emission and energy-loss probabilities of free electrons interacting with nanostructured samples. In addition, we calculate quantum-beat phenomena in bound-electron systems and wave function-dependent optical coherence in free-electron systems. Remarkably, the transition-current formalism captures more complex phenomena, such as many-body interference effects and super-radiance of both bound- and free-electron systems, second-order processes such as two-photon emission, and quantum recoil corrections to free-electron radiation. We review a variety of light–matter interactions in fields ranging from electron microscopy to nanophotonics and quantum optics, for which the transition-current theoretical formalism facilitates practical simulations and a deeper understanding of novel applications.},

Here, we present an advancement in correlated X-ray pair generation and detection by employing a two-dimensional pixelated detector to obtain the first direct image of the pair distribution. Our study explores and directly visualizes the down-conversion process, revealing the characteristic ring structure of coincident photon pairs and demonstrating robust spatial correlations. A significant finding is the observation of energy anti-correlation, achieved at an unprecedented rate of approximately 4,100 pairs/hour, far exceeding previous reports in the literature. We believe these results represent a significant leap in X-ray quantum imaging, unlocking the potential for enhanced imaging of biological materials with reduced doses and broadening the applicability of X-ray quantum optical technologies.},

            This chapter addresses fundamental concepts of X-ray optics and X-ray coherence, in view of the increasing number of X-ray applications requiring nano-focused X-ray beams. The chapter is meant as a tutorial to facilitate the understanding of later chapters of this book. After the introduction and an overview over focusing optics and recent benchmarks in X-ray focusing, we present refractive, reflective and diffractive X-ray optics in more detail. Particular emphasis is given to two kinds of X-ray optics which are particularly relevant for later chapters in this book, namely X-ray waveguides (XWG) and multilayer zone plates (MZP). Both are geared towards ultimate confinement and focusing, respectively, i.e. applications at the forefront of what is currently possible for multi-keV radiation. Since optics must be designed in view of coherence properties, we include a basic treatment of coherence theory and simulation for X-ray optics. Finally, the chapter closes with a brief outlook on compound (combined) optical schemes for hard X-ray microscopy.},

Such aberrations can be compensated by using a phase plate. However, current high numerical aperture lenses for nanometer resolution exhibit errors that exceed those that can be corrected by a single phase plate. To address this, we accumulate a large wavefront correction by propagation through a linear array of 3D-printed phase correcting elements.

            High‐performance focusing of X‐rays requires the realization of very challenging 3D geometries with nanoscale features, sub‐millimeter‐scale apertures, and high aspect ratios. A particularly difficult structure is the profile of an ideal zone plate called a kinoform, which is manufactured in nonideal approximated patterns, nonetheless requires complicated multistep fabrication processes. Here, 3D fabrication of high‐performance kinoforms with unprecedented aspect ratios out of low‐loss plastics using femtosecond two‐photon 3D nanoprinting is presented. A thorough characterization of the 3D‐printed kinoforms using direct soft X‐ray imaging and ptychography demonstrates superior performance with an efficiency reaching up to 20\%. An extended concept is proposed for on‐chip integration of various X‐ray optics toward high‐fidelity control of X‐ray wavefronts and ultimate efficiencies even for harder X‐rays. Initial results establish new, advanced focusing optics for both synchrotron and laboratory sources for a large variety of X‐ray techniques and applications ranging from materials science to medicine.},

Macroscopically, this is studied using optical techniques, such as photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy. However, excitation and emission pathways can vary at nanometer scales, preventing direct access, as no characterization technique has the relevant spatial, spectral, and time resolution. Here, using combined electron spectroscopies, we explore excitations’ creation and decay in two representative optical materials: plasmonic nanoparticles and luminescent two-dimensional layers. The analysis of the energy lost by an exciting electron that is coincident in time with a visible-ultraviolet photon unveils the decay pathways from excitation toward light emission. This is demonstrated for phase-locked (coherent) interactions (localized surface plasmons) and non–phase-locked ones (point defect excited states). The developed cathodoluminescence excitation spectroscopy images energy transfer pathways at the nanometer scale, widening the available toolset to explore nanoscale materials.

Gravitational-wave detectors use photons to continuously measure the positions of freely falling mirrors and so are affected by the SQL. We investigated the performance of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) after the experimental realization of frequency-dependent squeezing designed to surpass the SQL. For the LIGO Livingston detector, we found that the upgrade reduces quantum noise below the SQL by a maximum of three decibels between 35 and 75 hertz while achieving a broadband sensitivity improvement, increasing the overall detector sensitivity during astrophysical observations.

              Gravitational wave detectors use kilometers-long interferometers to measure tiny expansions and contractions of spacetime. The precision of those measurements is limited due to quantum mechanics. Theoretically, that quantum limit could be surpassed by using squeezed states of light, and a suitable filter cavity could extend the advantage over a wide frequency range (see the Perspective by Aso).

          , 
            Multipartite entangled states are crucial for numerous applications in quantum information science. However, the generation and verification of multipartite entanglement on fully controllable and scalable quantum platforms remains an outstanding challenge. We report the deterministic generation of an 18-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state and multicomponent atomic Schrödinger cat states of up to 20 qubits on a quantum processor, which features 20 superconducting qubits, also referred to as artificial atoms, interconnected by a bus resonator. By engineering a one-axis twisting Hamiltonian, the system of qubits, once initialized, coherently evolves to multicomponent atomic Schrödinger cat states—that is, superpositions of atomic coherent states including the GHZ state—at specific time intervals as expected. Our approach on a solid-state platform should not only stimulate interest in exploring the fundamental physics of quantum many-body systems, but also enable the development of applications in practical quantum metrology and quantum information processing.},

Particularly, they are promising platforms for studying thermionic emission. Here, we illustrate that using vdW heterostructure-based thermionic emission can enhance heat transfer in vacuum devices. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that this approach offers a promising solution to the long-standing overheating issue in X-ray tubes. Specifically, we show that the saturated target temperature of a 2000 W X-ray tube can be reduced from around 1200 celsius to 490 celsius. Additionally, our study demonstrates that by reducing the height of the Schottky barrier formed in the vdW heterostructures, the thermionic cooling performance can be enhanced. Our findings pave the way for the development of high-power X-ray tubes.},

	abstract = {Strong coupling in light-matter systems is a central concept in cavity quantum electrodynamics and is essential for many quantum technologies. Especially in the optical range, full control of highly connected multi-qubit systems necessitates quantum coherent probes with nanometric spatial resolution, which are currently inaccessible. Here, we propose the use of free electrons as high-resolution quantum sensors for strongly coupled light-matter systems. Shaping the free-electron wave packet enables the measurement of the quantum state of the entire hybrid systems. We specifically show how quantum interference of the free-electron wave packet gives rise to a quantum-enhanced sensing protocol for the position and dipole orientation of a subnanometer emitter inside a cavity. Our results showcase the great versatility and applicability of quantum interactions between free electrons and strongly coupled cavities, relying on the unique properties of free electrons as strongly interacting flying qubits with miniscule dimensions.

The enzyme was most active at pH 5.6 and at 40 degrees C with either Rhizopus cell wall or glycol chitosan as substrate, and was stable over a range of pH 4.5 to 7.5 at 40 degrees C for 3 h. The activity was lost by sulfhydryl reagents and restored by either reduced glutathione of L-cysteine.

              High-harmonic generation has been driving the development of attosecond science and sources. More recently, high-harmonic generation in solids has been adopted by other communities as a method to study material properties. However, so far high-harmonic generation has only been driven by classical light, despite theoretical proposals to do so with quantum states of light. Here we observe non-perturbative high-harmonic generation in solids driven by a macroscopic quantum state of light, a bright squeezed vacuum, which we generate in a single spatiotemporal mode. The process driven by a bright squeezed vacuum is considerably more efficient in the generation of high harmonics than classical light of the same mean intensity. Due to its broad photon-number distribution, covering states from 0 to 2 × 10

Hence, ultrafast electron and x-ray imaging tools have been developed to image the ultrafast dynamics of matter in real time and space. The cutting-edge temporal resolution of these imaging tools is on the order of a few tens to a hundred femtoseconds, limiting imaging to the atomic dynamics and leaving electron motion imaging out of reach. Here, we obtained the attosecond temporal resolution in the transmission electron microscope, which we coined “attomicroscopy.” We demonstrated this resolution by the attosecond diffraction measurements of the field-driven electron dynamics in graphene. This attosecond imaging tool would provide more insights into electron motion and directly connect it to the structural dynamics of matter in real-time and space domains, opening the door for long-anticipated real-life attosecond science applications in quantum physics, chemistry, and biology.

            Spatiotemporal sculpturing of light pulse with ultimately sophisticated structures represents a major goal of the everlasting pursue of ultra-fast information transmission and processing as well as ultra-intense energy concentration and extraction. It also holds the key to unlock new extraordinary fundamental physical effects. Traditionally, spatiotemporal light pulses are always treated as spatiotemporally separable wave packet as solution of the Maxwell’s equations. In the past decade, however, more generalized forms of spatiotemporally nonseparable solution started to emerge with growing importance for their striking physical effects. This roadmap intends to highlight the recent advances in the creation and control of increasingly complex spatiotemporally sculptured pulses, from spatiotemporally separable to complex nonseparable states, with diverse geometric and topological structures, presenting a bird’s eye viewpoint on the zoology of spatiotemporal light fields and the outlook of future trends and open challenges.},

            Space‐time wave packets are electromagnetic waves with strong correlations between their spatial and temporal degrees of freedom. These wave packets have gained much attention for fundamental properties like propagation invariance and user‐designed group velocities, and for potential applications like optical microscopy, micromanipulation, and laser micromachining. Here, free‐electron radiation is presented as a natural and versatile source of space‐time wave packets that are ultra‐broadband and highly tunable in frequency. For instance, ab initio theory and numerical simulations show that the intensity profile of space‐time wave packets from Smith‐Purcell radiation can be directly tailored through the grating properties, as well as the velocity and shape of the electron bunches. The result of this work indicates a viable way of generating space‐time wave packets at exotic frequencies such as the terahertz and X‐ray regimes, potentially paving the way toward new methods of shaping electromagnetic wave packets through free‐electron radiation.},

However, water-window X-ray sources whose output photon energy can be arbitrarily specified - a crucial feature in many high-contrast imaging applications - are still challenging to obtain except at large synchrotron facilities. Here, we present a solution to this challenge by demonstrating table-top, water-window X-ray generation from free electron-driven van der Waals materials, resulting in output photon energies that can be continuously tuned across the entire water window regime. In addition, we present a truly predictive theoretical framework that combines first-principles electromagnetism with Monte Carlo simulations to accurately predict the photon flux and brightness in absolute numbers. Using this framework, we theoretically obtain fundamental scaling laws for the tunable photon flux, showing good agreement with experimental results and providing a path to the design of powerful emitters based on free electron-driven quantum materials. We show that we can achieve photon fluxes needed for imaging and spectroscopy applications (over 1E8 photons per second on sample) where compactness is important, and the ultrahigh fluxes of synchrotron sources are not needed. Importantly, our theory highlights the critical role played by the large mean free paths and interlayer atomic spacings unique to van der Waals structures, showing the latter's advantages over other materials in generating water window X-rays. Our results should pave the way to advanced techniques and new modalities in water-window X-ray generation and high-resolution biological imaging.},

In particular, free electron light sources have gained much attention due to their ability to tune and direct light emission. Here, we show that radiation from free electrons passing through a 100 nm wide nanohole can reach as high as 90\% of the theoretical limit. This is accomplished through the introduction of a circular nanoridge around the hole to form a structure we call the nanowell. The power radiated from the nanowell exceeds that of a regular nanohole by over 100 times and that of nanoholes surrounded by other features, such as bullseyes, by similar enhancement factors. Upon varying the structural parameters of the nanowell, the peak output wavelength can be tuned over a broad frequency range from the visible to the near-infrared. This reveals a route to extracting power from free electrons via material nanopatterning.},

            Metasurfaces are subwavelength spatial variations in geometry and material where the structures are of negligible thickness compared to the wavelength of light and are optimized for far-field applications, such as controlling the wavefronts of electromagnetic waves. Here, we investigate the potential of the metasurface near-field profile, generated by an incident few-cycle pulse laser, to facilitate the generation of high-frequency light from free electrons. In particular, the metasurface near-field contains higher-order spatial harmonics that can be leveraged to generate multiple higher-harmonic X-ray frequency peaks. We show that the X-ray spectral profile can be arbitrarily shaped by controlling the metasurface geometry, the electron energy, and the incidence angle of the laser input. Using ab initio simulations, we predict bright and monoenergetic X-rays, achieving energies of 30 keV (with harmonics spaced by 3 keV) from 5-MeV electrons using 3.4-eV plasmon polaritons on a metasurface with a period of 85 nm. As an example, we present the design of a four-color X-ray source, a potential candidate for tabletop multicolor hard X-ray spectroscopy. Our developments could help pave the way for compact multi-harmonic sources of high-energy photons, which have potential applications in industry, medicine, and the fundamental sciences.},

              Inorganic scintillators play a major role in ionizing radiation detection due to their high versatility to detect multiple radiation sources such as X-rays, gamma-rays, alpha, beta, and neutron particles, and their fast and high light yield, making them especially convenient for imaging, spectroscopy, and timing applications. Scintillators-based detection systems are found, among various applications, in medical imaging, homeland security, high-energy physics, industrial control, oil drilling explorations, and energy management. This Review discusses advances and prospects of perovskite scintillators, particularly low-dimensional hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite crystals and all-inorganic perovskite nanocrystals.

We review recent strategies to further improve light yield, decay time, and coincidence timing resolution through light-matter interactions such as extraction efficiency enhancement and Purcell-enhanced scintillators. These advancements in light yields and decay times of perovskite scintillators will be particularly useful in the medical and security applications.},

By driving the vdW heterostructures with free electrons in a table-top setup, we generate x-ray photons whose output spectral profile can be user-customized via the heterostructure design and even controlled in real time.
