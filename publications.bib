	abstract = {¬© 2015 Optical Society of America. We propose and experimentally demonstrate an approach to efficiently tune the dispersion of a designer-plasmonic resonator, or a plasmonic 'meta-atom', by incorporating an extra ground plane underneath. We demonstrate that this ground plane is able to enhance resonances, and the enhancing effect can render those higher-order azimuthal modes, being absent in previously reported designer-plasmonic resonators, experimentally observable. After incorporating the ground plane, all resonance modes are red shifted with their Q factors enhanced. By increasing the separation from the planar resonator to the underneath ground plane, all enhanced modes are blue shifted with Q factors decreased slightly, whose trend is opposite to increasing the thickness of a dielectric substrate of a common meta-atom without a ground. These results may find potential applications in tunable designer-plasmonic sensors and plasmonic metamaterial designs.},

        abstract = {We report the first experimental realization of a three-dimensional thermal cloak shielding an air bubble in a bulk metal without disturbing the external conductive thermal flux. The cloak is made of a thin layer of homogeneous and isotropic material with specially designed three-dimensional manufacturing. The cloak‚Äôs thickness is 100‚Äâ‚Äâùúá‚Å¢m while the cloaked air bubble has a diameter of 1 cm, achieving the ratio between dimensions of the cloak and the cloaked object 2 orders smaller than previous thermal cloaks, which were mainly realized in a two-dimensional geometry. This work can find applications in novel thermal devices in the three-dimensional physical space.},
