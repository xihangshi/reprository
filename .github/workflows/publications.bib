	abstract = {Tunable sources of X-ray radiation are widely used for imaging and spectroscopy in fundamental science, medicine and industry. The growing demand for highly tunable, high-brightness laboratory-scale X-ray sources motivates research into new fundamental mechanisms of X-ray generation. Here, we demonstrate the ability of van der Waals materials to serve as a platform for tunable X-ray generation when irradiated by moderately relativistic electrons available, for example, from a transmission electron microscope. The radiation spectrum can be precisely controlled by tuning the acceleration voltage of the incident electrons, as well as by our proposed approach: adjusting the lattice structure of the van der Waals material. We present experimental results for both methods, observing the energy tunability of X-ray radiation from the van der Waals materials WSe2, CrPS4, MnPS3, FePS3, CoPS3 and NiPS3. Our findings demonstrate the concept of material design at the atomic level, using van der Waals heterostructures and other atomic superlattices, for exploring novel phenomena of X-ray physics.},

	abstract = {Quantum light–matter interactions of bound electron systems have been studied extensively. By contrast, quantum interactions of free electrons with light have only become accessible in recent years, following the discovery of photon-induced near-field electron microscopy (PINEM). So far, the fundamental free electron–light interaction in all PINEM experiments has remained weak due to its localized near-field nature, which imposes an energy–momentum mismatch between electrons and light. Here, we demonstrate a strong interaction between free-electron waves and light waves, resulting from precise energy–momentum phase-matching with the extended propagating light field. By exchanging hundreds of photons with the field, each electron simultaneously accelerates and decelerates in a coherent manner. Consequently, each electron’s quantum wavefunction evolves into a quantized energy comb, spanning a bandwidth of over 1,700 eV, requiring us to extend the PINEM theory. Our observation of coherent electron phase-matching with a propagating wave is a type of inverse-Cherenkov interaction that occurs with a quantum electron wavefunction, demonstrating how the extended nature of the electron wavefunction can alter stimulated electron–light interactions.},

Unlike in the X-ray regime, control over light waves in the visible and IR regimes is ubiquitous in a vast range of applications, and typically relies on widely available optical components. However, analogous optical elements for X-rays are usually inefficient and challenging to fabricate. Here, we propose a method for shaping X-ray waves directly at the source, using the interaction of free electrons with crystalline materials. Specifically, by inducing strain on van der Waals materials, we control their interaction with free electrons in a manner that tunes the emissions of the X-rays and forms caustic X-ray beams. The development of wave-shaping concepts like caustics generation in the X-ray spectral range could benefit from achievements in this field in the optical range and may help bypass the noted limits of current X-ray optics technology. Looking forward, shaping the interference of X-rays at the atomic scale could enable further developments in high-resolution X-ray science.},

In spite of this, many forms of tailoring waves that had substantial impact on applications in the optical regime have remained out of reach in the X-ray regime. This disparity fundamentally arises from the tendency of refractive indices of all materials to approach unity at high frequencies, making X-ray-optical components such as lenses and mirrors much harder to create and often less efficient. Here, we propose a new concept for X-ray focusing based on inducing a curved wavefront into the X-ray generation process, resulting in the intrinsic focusing of X-ray waves. This concept can be seen as effectively integrating the optics to be part of the emission mechanism, thus bypassing the efficiency limits imposed by X-ray optical components, enabling the creation of nanobeams with nanoscale focal spot sizes and micrometer-scale focal lengths. Specifically, we implement this concept by designing aperiodic vdW heterostructures that shape X-rays when driven by free electrons. The parameters of the focused hotspot, such as lateral size and focal depth, are tunable as a function of an interlayer spacing chirp and electron energy. Looking forward, ongoing advances in the creation of many-layer vdW heterostructures open unprecedented horizons of focusing and arbitrary shaping of X-ray nanobeams.},

Launching of plasmons by swift electrons has long been used in electron energy?loss spectroscopy (EELS) to investigate the plasmonic properties of ultrathin, or two-dimensional (2D), electron systems. However, the question of how a swift electron generates plasmons in space and time has never been answered. We address this issue by calculating and demonstrating the spatial-temporal dynamics of 2D plasmon generation in graphene. We predict a jet-like rise of excessive charge concentration that delays the generation of 2D plasmons in EELS, exhibiting an analog to the hydrodynamic Rayleigh jet in a splashing phenomenon before the launching of ripples. The photon radiation, analogous to the splashing sound, accompanies the plasmon emission and can be understood as being shaken off by the Rayleigh jet?like charge concentration. Considering this newly revealed process, we argue that previous estimates on the yields of graphene plasmons in EELS need to be reevaluated.},

Furthermore, we show how to shape the bremsstrahlung X-ray emission pattern into arbitrary angular emission profiles for purposes such as unidirectionality and multi-directionality. Importantly, we find that these enhancements and shaped emission profiles cannot be attributed solely to the spatial overlap between the electron probability distribution and the atomic centers, as predicted by the paraxial and non-recoil theory for free electron light emission. Our work highlights an unprecedented regime of free electron light emission where electron waveshaping provides multi-dimensional control over practical radiation processes like bremsstrahlung.

We predict an optimum value of 0.4266, resulting in the maximum energy gain of 28.27 keV for an optical pulse energy of only 0.22 nJ and duration 1 ps. The acceleration gradient is 1.05\&\#x2005;GeV/m, which is lower than the maximum imposed by the damage threshold of Si waveguides.

	abstract = {Free-electron radiation phenomena are treated almost exclusively with classical electrodynamics, despite the intrinsic interaction being that of quantum electrodynamics. The lack of quantumness arises from the vast disparity between the electron energy and the much smaller photon energy, creating a small cross-section that makes quantum effects negligible. Here we identify a fundamentally distinct phenomenon of electron radiation that bypasses this energy disparity, and thus displays extremely strong quantum features. This phenomenon arises from free-electron elastic recoil, which can influence fundamental radiation processes in ways thought so far to necessitate inelastic scattering. The underlying reason for the quantum radiation features, which have no counterparts in classical theory, is the entanglement between each elastically recoiled electron and the photons it emitted. We show that this phenomenon is more accessible than all other types of quantum features in free-electron radiation and can be detected in current experimental setups such as electron microscopes. These quantum radiation features could guide the development of compact coherent X-ray sources facilitated by nanophotonics and quantum optics.},

            Free‐electron radiation is a fundamental photon emission process that is induced by fast‐moving electrons interacting with optical media. Historically, it has been understood that, just like any other photon emission process, free‐electron radiation must be constrained within a finite time interval known as the “formation time,” whose concept is applicable to both Cherenkov radiation and transition radiation, the two basic mechanisms describing radiation from a bulk medium and from an interface, respectively. Here, this work reveals an alternative mechanism of free‐electron radiation far beyond the previously defined formation time. It occurs when a fast electron crosses the interface between vacuum and a plasmonic medium supporting bulk plasmons. While emitted continuously from the crossing point on the interface—thus consistent with the features of transition radiation—the extra radiation beyond the conventional formation time is supported by a long tail of bulk plasmons following the electron's trajectory deep into the plasmonic medium. Such a plasmonic tail mixes surface and bulk effects, and provides a sustained channel for electron–interface interaction. These results also settle the historical debate in Ferrell radiation, regarding whether it is a surface or bulk effect, from transition radiation or plasmonic oscillation.},

However, the conceptual three-dimensional invisibility cloak that exactly follows specifications of transformation optics is formidably difficult to implement, while the simplified cylindrical cloak that has been experimentally realized is inherently visible. On the other hand, the recent carpet cloak model has acquired remarkable experimental development, including a recently demonstrated full-parameter carpet cloak without any approximation in the required constitutive parameters.

              Transport of subwavelength electromagnetic (EM) energy has been achieved through near‐field coupling of highly confined surface EM modes supported by plasmonic nanoparticles, in a configuration usually on a two‐dimensional (2D) substrate. Vertical transport of similar modes along the third dimension, on the other hand, can bring more flexibility in designs of functional photonic devices, but this phenomenon has not been observed in reality. In this paper, designer (or spoof) surface plasmon resonators (‘plasmonic meta‐atoms’) are stacked in the direction vertical to their individual planes in demonstrating vertical transport of subwavelength localized surface EM modes. The dispersion relation of this vertical transport is determined from coupled‐mode theory and is verified with a near‐field transmission spectrum and field mapping with a microwave near‐field scanning stage. This work extends the near‐field coupled resonator optical waveguide (CROW) theory into the vertical direction, and may find applications in novel three‐dimensional slow‐light structures, filters, and photonic circuits.

Here in a designer surface plasmon platform consisting of tunable metallic sub-wavelength structures, we construct photonic topological edge states and probe their robustness against a variety of defect classes, including some common time-reversal-invariant photonic defects that can break the topological protection, but do not exist in electronic topological insulators.

            It is well known that optical media create artificial geometry for light and curved geometry acts as an effective optical medium. This correspondence originates from the form invariance of Maxwell’s equations, which recently has spawned a booming field called ‘transformation optics’. Here we investigate responses of three transformation media under electromagnetic pulses and find that pulse radiation can induce unbalanced net force on transformation media, which will cause translation and rotation of transformation media although their final momentum can still be zero. Therefore, the transformation media do not necessarily stay the same after an electromagnetic wave passes through.},
