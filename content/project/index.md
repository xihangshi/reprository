      title: Research Interests
      text: |
        My research focuses on free-electron raidation mediated by bulk and nanophotonic materials. In particular, we strive to deepen our unerstanding of quantum science in the field, and propose new applications based on the quantum materials and quantum technologies. ![roadmap](Research_dir.jpg)

        I would like of investigate novel phonomenon that is [beyond the current understanding](/tag/fundamental-breakthrough/) in the field of free-electron radiation. In particular, I am interested in investigating the radiation generated by quantum electrons. The quantum properties of electrons have been investigated mostly in the field of electron microscopy following Nobel Laureate [Ahmed Zewail's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmed_Zewail) research on free electrons interacting with the near-field of light.
