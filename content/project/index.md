            My research focuses on free-electron-driven nanophotonics, including free-electron radiation and the interaction of free electrons with the near-field of light. I aim to develop mechanisms to enhance the coupling strength between free electrons and light, and deepen our understanding of quantum phenomena in this field. Beyond fundamental investigations, I strive to propose new applications that leverage advances in quantum materials and quantum technologies.

          Free electrons have quantum structures that go beyond the simple point-charge model. Since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmed_Zewail"> Nobel Laureate Ahmed Zewailâ€™s </a> pioneering work in 2009 on free-electron interaction with light near-fields, these quantum properties have been widely studied, especially in electron microscopy. Today, researchers are exploring how to use these quantum features; for example, ultrashort electron pulses enable attosecond electron microscopy to capture ultrafast optical dynamics. Here, we investigate how these quantum structures affect  <a href="/tag/free-electron-quantum-optics/">free-electron radiation </a>. This is crucial when low-energy electrons interact with nanostructures, where <a href="/tag/fundamental-breakthrough/"> the quantum wavepacket nature can introduce a  paradigm shift </a> in radiation behavior. For instance, we find that entanglement between free electrons and emitted photons can shift and split radiation spectra compared to classical predictions. Even more intriguing, the quantum structure offers new degrees of freedom to control radiation, especially in challenging regimes like X-rays, beyond the reach of traditional optical methods.

           Control over light waves in the visible and infrared regimes is ubiquitous in a vast range of applications, and typically relies on widely available optical components. However, analogous optical elements for X-rays are usually inefficient and challenging to fabricate. We propose <a href="/tag/free-electron-x-ray-optics/">generating shaped X-rays</a> directly from free electrons interacting with nanomaterials. X-ray focused beam and Airy beams have been proposed, mediated by van der Waals heterostructures. Looking forward, we aim to develop novel schemes that help bypass the noted limitations of current X-ray optics technology.

          The current technology for generating quantum light mainly relies on the nonlinearity of materials, which limits the available spectrum of quantum light states. Free electrons can also act as nonlinear media during their interaction with light, such as in Compton scattering and free-electron radiation. Recent investigations of free-electron radiation treat this process as the scattering of entangled electron-photon pairs, giving rise to a new field called free-electron quantum optics. In this field, quantum light can be heralded by post-selecting the electron, for example, in energy space. One significant advantage of this approach is the ability to generate quantum light in regimes, such as the X-ray regime, that are inaccessible or challenging for traditional methods.
