      title: Research Interests
      text: |
        My research focuses on free-electron raidation mediated by bulk and nanophotonic materials. In particular, we strive to deepen our unerstanding of quantum science in the field, and propose new applications based on the quantum materials and quantum technologies. ![roadmap](Research_dir.jpg)

        I would like to investigate novel phenomena that are [beyond the current understanding](/tag/fundamental-breakthrough/) in the field of free-electron radiation. In particular, I am interested in studying the radiation generated by quantum electrons. The quantum properties of free electrons have been widely explored in the field of electron microscopy, following Nobel Laureate [Ahmed Zewail's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmed_Zewail) research on free electrons interacting with the near-field of light in 2009. The quantum aspect of free electrons could generate [novel electron radition phenomena](/tag/free-electron-quantum-optics/) and revolutionize the next generation of compact light sources.
