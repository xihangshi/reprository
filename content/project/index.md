            My research focuses on free-electron-driven nanophotonics, including free-electron radiation and the interaction of free electrons with the near-field of light. I aim to develop mechanisms to enhance the coupling strength between free electrons and light, and deepen our understanding of quantum phenomena in this field. Beyond fundamental investigations, I strive to propose new applications that leverage advances in quantum materials and quantum technologies.
