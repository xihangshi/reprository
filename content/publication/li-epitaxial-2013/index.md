abstract: We demonstrate synthesis of a new type of heterostructures that comprise
  two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets (NSs) epitaxially grown at one-dimensional (1D)
  nanowires (NWs). The synthesis involves materials with a graphite-like layered structure
  in which covalently bonded layers are held by weak van der Waals forces. GeS was
  used as a prototype material in this work. The synthesis also involves a seeded-growth
  process, where GeS NWs are grown first as seeds followed by a seeded growth of NSs
  at the pre-grown NWs. We observe that exposing the pre-grown NWs to air prior to
  the seeded growth is critical for the formation of NSs to yield NS-NW heterostructures.
  Our experimental results suggest that this might be due to a mild oxidation at the
  NW surface caused by the air exposure, which could subsequently facilitate the nucleation
  of NSs at the NWs. It also suggests that the surface oxidation needs to be controlled
  in a proper range in order to achieve optimized NS growths. We believe that this
  synthetic strategy may generally apply to the growth of NS-NW heterostructures of
  other layered chalcogenide materials. NS-NW heterostructures provide capabilities
  to monolithically integrate the functionality of 1D NWs and 2D NSs into a 3D space.
  It holds great potential in applications that request complex nanomaterials with
  multiple functionality, high surface area, and efficient charge transport, such
  as energy storage, chemical sensing, solar energy conversion, and 3D electric and
  photonic devices. Â© 2013 American Chemical Society.
