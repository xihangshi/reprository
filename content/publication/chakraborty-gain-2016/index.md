abstract: 'Lasers emit coherent light at wavelengths that are well defined. These
  wavelengths are usually fixed once the device has been fabricated. Now, Chakraborty
  et al. have combined an atomically thin graphene sheet with terahertz quantum cascade
  lasers to realize a terahertz laser that can be tuned via the carrier doping level
  of the graphene layer (see the Perspective by Polini). The demonstration opens up
  the possibility of reversible control over the laser emission through the integration
  of graphene waveguides.Science, this issue p. 246; see also p. 229Two-dimensional
  graphene plasmon-based technologies will enable the development of fast, compact,
  and inexpensive active photonic elements because, unlike plasmons in other materials,
  graphene plasmons can be tuned via the doping level. Such tuning is harnessed within
  terahertz quantum cascade lasers to reversibly alter their emission. This is achieved
  in two key steps: first, by exciting graphene plasmons within an aperiodic lattice
  laser and, second, by engineering photon lifetimes, linking grapheneâ€™s Fermi energy
  with the round-trip gain. Modal gain and hence laser spectra are highly sensitive
  to the doping of an integrated, electrically controllable, graphene layer. Demonstration
  of the integrated graphene plasmon laser principle lays the foundation for a new
  generation of active, programmable plasmonic metamaterials with major implications
  across photonics, material sciences, and nanotechnology.'
