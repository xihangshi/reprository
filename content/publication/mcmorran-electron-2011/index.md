abstract: Electron beams with helical wavefronts carrying orbital angular momentum
  are expected to provide new capabilities for electron microscopy and other applications.
  We used nanofabricated diffraction holograms in an electron microscope to produce
  multiple electron vortex beams with well-defined topological charge. Beams carrying
  quantized amounts of orbital angular momentum (up to 100‚Ñè) per electron were observed.
  We describe how the electrons can exhibit such orbital motion in free space in the
  absence of any confining potential or external field, and discuss how these beams
  can be applied to improved electron microscopy of magnetic and biological specimens.
