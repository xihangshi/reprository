abstract: 'Entangled photon pairs are a fundamental component for testing the foundations
  of quantum mechanics, and for modern quantum technologies such as teleportation
  and secured communication. Current state-of-the-art sources are based on nonlinear
  processes that are limited in their efficiency and wavelength tunability. This motivates
  the exploration of physical mechanisms for entangled photon generation, with a special
  interest in mechanisms that can be heralded, preferably at telecommunications wavelengths.
  Here we present a mechanism for the generation of heralded entangled photons from
  Rydberg atom cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity QED). We propose a scheme to
  demonstrate the mechanism and quantify its expected performance. The heralding of
  the process enables non-destructive detection of the photon pairs. The entangled
  photons are produced by exciting a rubidium atom to a Rydberg state, from where
  the atom decays via two-photon emission (TPE). A Rydberg blockade helps to excite
  a single Rydberg excitation while the input light field is more efficiently collectively
  absorbed by all the atoms. The TPE rate is significantly enhanced by a designed
  photonic cavity, whose many resonances also translate into high-dimensional entanglement.
  The resulting high-dimensionally entangled photons are entangled in more than one
  degree of freedom: in all of their spectral components, in addition to the polarizationâ€”forming
  a hyper-entangled state, which is particularly interesting in high information capacity
  quantum communication. We characterize the photon comb states by analyzing the Hong-Ou-Mandel
  interference and propose proof-of-concept experiments.'
