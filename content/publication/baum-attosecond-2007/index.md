abstract: In this contribution, we consider the advancement of ultrafast electron
  diffraction and microscopy to cover the attosecond time domain. The concept is centered
  on the compression of femtosecond electron packets to trains of 15-attosecond pulses
  by the use of the ponderomotive force in synthesized gratings of optical fields.
  Such attosecond electron pulses are significantly shorter than those achievable
  with extreme UV light sources near 25 nm (≈50 eV) and have the potential for applications
  in the visualization of ultrafast electron dynamics, especially of atomic structures,
  clusters of atoms, and some materials. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences
