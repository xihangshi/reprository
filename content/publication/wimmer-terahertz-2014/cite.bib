 abstract = {Nanoscale metallic tips are a useful source of electrons for material characterization. It is now shown how terahertz radiation can provide precision control and enhancement of photoelectron emission from these sources. The approach can shape the spectrum of the electron pulse, which could pave the way to improvements in ultrafast electron diffraction and transmission electron microscopy.},
