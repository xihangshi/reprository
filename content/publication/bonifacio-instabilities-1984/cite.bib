 abstract = {We describe the quantum initiation of the free-electron laser, starting from the N-electron position and momentum quantum fluctuations, both in the small-gain and in the high-gain regime. The Glauber distribution P(α) for the field is derived, obtaining the displaced gaussian which represents the superposition of a coherent field (stimulated emission) and an incoherent one (spontaneous emission). In the experimental gain regime the build-up time of radiation is estimated, showing its proportionality to ln √N.},
