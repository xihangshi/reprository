abstract: We describe the quantum initiation of the free-electron laser, starting
  from the N-electron position and momentum quantum fluctuations, both in the small-gain
  and in the high-gain regime. The Glauber distribution P(α) for the field is derived,
  obtaining the displaced gaussian which represents the superposition of a coherent
  field (stimulated emission) and an incoherent one (spontaneous emission). In the
  experimental gain regime the build-up time of radiation is estimated, showing its
  proportionality to ln √N.
