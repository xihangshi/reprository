abstract: The main theme of this book is the interaction of electrons with electromagnetic
  waves in the presence of periodic or quasi-periodic structures in vacuum. The first
  chapter describes the principal interaction mechanisms of a single particle with
  radiation. In the two chapters that follow, elementary electromagnetic and particle
  dynamics phenomena, relevant to the theme of the book, are discussed. With the background
  established, the distributed beam-wave interaction is investigated in detail in
  the fourth chapter. Beyond the basics of Pierce's theory extended to the relativistic
  regime, the analysis includes the interaction in a tapered structure, phase-space
  distribution, reflections, lethargy and saturation effects. High-efficiency traveling
  wave output structures are considered in Chap. 6 where the analysis is extended
  to quasi-periodic structures. In the last two chapters the fundamentals of free
  electron lasers and linear accelerators are presented. Each one of these two chapters
  consists of one part presenting the basic operation principles followed by an introduction
  to various alternative schemes.
