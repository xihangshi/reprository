abstract: Although electrons and photons are the most widely researched elementary
  particles, their interactions outside of the confines of a material are not yet
  fully explored. Here, we report the use of nonlinear-optical two-photon transitions
  for the quantum-coherent control of a free-electron matter wave in free space. We
  superimpose an electron beam with two crossed laser beams of different photon energies
  for non-linear Compton scattering. At suitable angle combinations, the electron
  energy spectrum becomes modulated into discrete energy sidebands with thousands
  of interference maxima. We explain our observations by the cascaded addition and
  subtraction of two-photon pairs under three-body conservation of energy and momentum.
  Calculations reveal that the electron matter wave converts into pulses of few-attosecond
  duration. These results show the general importance of matter wave coherences in
  scattering phenomena and provide a way for investigating and creating quantum correlations
  and entanglement between massive and massless elementary particles without the need
  for a classical coupling construct.
