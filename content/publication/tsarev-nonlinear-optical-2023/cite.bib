 abstract = {Although electrons and photons are the most widely researched elementary particles, their interactions outside of the confines of a material are not yet fully explored. Here, we report the use of nonlinear-optical two-photon transitions for the quantum-coherent control of a free-electron matter wave in free space. We superimpose an electron beam with two crossed laser beams of different photon energies for non-linear Compton scattering. At suitable angle combinations, the electron energy spectrum becomes modulated into discrete energy sidebands with thousands of interference maxima. We explain our observations by the cascaded addition and subtraction of two-photon pairs under three-body conservation of energy and momentum. Calculations reveal that the electron matter wave converts into pulses of few-attosecond duration. These results show the general importance of matter wave coherences in scattering phenomena and provide a way for investigating and creating quantum correlations and entanglement between massive and massless elementary particles without the need for a classical coupling construct.},
