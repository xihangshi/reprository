abstract: Thin-film nanostructures with embedded Mtextbackslash\"ossbauer nuclei have
  been successfully used for x-ray quantum optical applications with hard x-rays coupling
  in grazing incidence. Here we address theoretically a new geometry, in which hard
  x-rays are coupled in forward incidence (front coupling), setting the stage for
  waveguide QED with nuclear x-ray resonances. We present in a self-contained manner
  a general model based on the Green's function formalism of the field-nucleus interaction
  in one dimensional waveguides, and show that it combines aspects of both nuclear
  forward scattering, visible as dynamical beating in the spatio-temporal response,
  and the resonance structure from grazing incidence, visible in the spectrum of guided
  modes. The interference of multiple modes is shown to play an important role, resulting
  in beats with wavelengths on the order of tens of microns, on the scale of practical
  photolithography. This allows for the design of special sample geometries to explore
  the resonant response or micro-striped waveguides, opening a new toolbox of geometrical
  design for hard X-ray quantum optics.
