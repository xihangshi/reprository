abstract: Today, it is well known that light possesses a linear momentum that is along
  the propagation direction. Besides, scientists also discovered that light can possess
  an angular momentum, a spin angular momentum (SAM) associated with circular polarization
  and an orbital angular momentum (OAM) owing to the azimuthally dependent phase.
  Even though such angular momenta are longitudinal in general, an SAM transverse
  to the propagation direction has opened up a variety of key applications1. In contrast,
  investigations of the transverse OAM are rare due to its complex nature. Here, we
  demonstrate a three-dimensional wave packet that is a spatiotemporal (ST) optical
  vortex with a controllable purely transverse OAM. Contrary to the transverse SAM,
  the magnitude of the transverse OAM carried by the ST vortex is scalable to a larger
  value by simple adjustments. Since the ST vortex carries a controllable OAM uniquely
  in the transverse dimension, it has strong potential for novel applications that
  may not be possible otherwise. The scheme reported here can be readily adapted for
  other spectral regimes and different wave fields, opening opportunities for the
  study and applications of ST vortices in a wide range of areas.
