abstract: 'We visualized negative refraction of phonon polaritons, which occurs at
  the interface between two natural crystals. The polaritons?hybrids of infrared photons
  and lattice vibrations?form collimated rays that display negative refraction when
  passing through a planar interface between the two hyperbolic van der Waals materials:
  molybdenum oxide (MoO3) and isotopically pure hexagonal boron nitride (h11BN). At
  a special frequency ?0, these rays can circulate along closed diamond-shaped trajectories.
  We have shown that polariton eigenmodes display regions of both positive and negative
  dispersion interrupted by multiple gaps that result from polaritonic-level repulsion
  and strong coupling. Refraction is a familiar effect in which a light beam alters
  direction as it propagates from one medium to another. Negative refraction is a
  nonintuitive but well-established effect in which the light beam is bent in the
  ?wrong? direction. Two groups now independently demonstrate negative refraction
  at the interface of two-dimensional van der Waal materials. Hu et al. used molybdenum
  trioxide with a graphene overlayer to show that in-plane negative refraction of
  mid-infrared (mid-IR) polaritons occurs at the interface and is gate tunable. Sternbach
  et al. used molybdenum trioxide/hexagonal boron nitride bicrystals to show that
  negative refraction of mid-IR polaritons occurs for propagation normal to the interface.
  Polaritonic negative refraction in the mid-IR provides opportunities for optical
  and thermal applications such as IR super-resolution imaging, nanoscale thermal
  manipulation, and chemical sensing devices with enhanced sensitivity. ?ISO Nanoscale
  negative refraction is demonstrated for polaritons propagating normal to the interface
  of 2D bicrystals.'
