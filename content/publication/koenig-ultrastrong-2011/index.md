abstract: As mechanical structures enter the nanoscale regime, the influence of van
  der Waals forces increases. Graphene is attractive for nanomechanical systems1,2
  because its Young's modulus and strength are both intrinsically high, but the mechanical
  behaviour of graphene is also strongly influenced by the van der Waals force3,4.
  For example, this force clamps graphene samples to substrates, and also holds together
  the individual graphene sheets in multilayer samples. Here we use a pressurized
  blister test to directly measure the adhesion energy of graphene sheets with a silicon
  oxide substrate. We find an adhesion energy of 0.45±0.02Jm-2 for monolayer graphene
  and 0.31±0.03Jm-2 for samples containing two to five graphene sheets. These values
  are larger than the adhesion energies measured in typical micromechanical structures
  and are comparable to solid-liquid adhesion energies5-7. We attribute this to the
  extreme flexibility of graphene, which allows it to conform to the topography of
  even the smoothest substrates, thus making its interaction with the substrate more
  liquid-like than solid-like. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.
