abstract: Cherenkov radiation is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature. It describes electromagnetic
  radiation from a charged particle moving in a medium with a uniform velocity larger
  than the phase velocity of light in the same medium. Such a picture is typically
  adopted in the investigation of traditional Cherenkov radiation as well as its counterparts
  in different branches of physics, including nonlinear optics, spintronics and plasmonics.
  In these cases, the radiation emitted spreads along a \"cone\", making it impractical
  for most applications. Here, we employ a self-accelerating optical pump wave-packet
  to demonstrate controlled shaping of one type of generalized Cherenkov radiation
  - dispersive waves in optical fibers. We show that, by tuning the parameters of
  the wave-packet, the emitted waves can be judiciously compressed and focused at
  desired locations, paving the way to such control in any physical system.
