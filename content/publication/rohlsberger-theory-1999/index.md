abstract: The dynamical theory of nuclear resonant diffraction is applied to the case
  of grazing incidence reflection. The solution of the dynamical equations is obtained
  by evaluation of a matrix exponential. This formalism is applied to grazing incidence
  reflection from arbitrary stratified media. However, the basic formalism is not
  restricted to this case, but can be used to describe a wide range of diffraction
  phenomena. This is demonstrated in the case of grazing incidence diffraction from
  gratings in the n-beam case. Moreover, the theory is extended to describe the influence
  of surface and boundary roughness.
