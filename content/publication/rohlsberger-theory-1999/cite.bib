 abstract = {The dynamical theory of nuclear resonant diffraction is applied to the case of grazing incidence reflection. The solution of the dynamical equations is obtained by evaluation of a matrix exponential. This formalism is applied to grazing incidence reflection from arbitrary stratified media. However, the basic formalism is not restricted to this case, but can be used to describe a wide range of diffraction phenomena. This is demonstrated in the case of grazing incidence diffraction from gratings in the n-beam case. Moreover, the theory is extended to describe the influence of surface and boundary roughness.},
