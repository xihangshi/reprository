abstract: Efficient nanoscale light sources are sought after for applications such
  as sensing, imaging, and the development of photonic circuits. In particular, free
  electron light sources have gained much attention due to their ability to tune and
  direct light emission. Here, we show that radiation from free electrons passing
  through a 100Â nm wide nanohole can reach as high as 90% of the theoretical limit.
  This is accomplished through the introduction of a circular nanoridge around the
  hole to form a structure we call the nanowell. The power radiated from the nanowell
  exceeds that of a regular nanohole by over 100 times and that of nanoholes surrounded
  by other features, such as bullseyes, by similar enhancement factors. Upon varying
  the structural parameters of the nanowell, the peak output wavelength can be tuned
  over a broad frequency range from the visible to the near-infrared. This reveals
  a route to extracting power from free electrons via material nanopatterning.
