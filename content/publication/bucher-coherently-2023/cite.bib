 abstract = {Accessing the low-energy non-equilibrium dynamics of materials with simultaneous spatial and temporal resolutions has been a bold frontier of electron microscopy in recent years. One of the main challenges is the ability to retrieve extremely weak signals while simultaneously disentangling amplitude and phase information. Here, we present an algorithm-based microscopy approach that uses light-induced electron modulation to demonstrate the coherent amplification effect in electron imaging of optical near-fields. We provide a simultaneous time-, space-, and phase-resolved measurement in a micro-drum made from a hexagonal boron nitride membrane, visualizing the sub-cycle spatio-temporal dynamics of 2D polariton wavepackets therein. The phase-resolved measurement reveals vortex-anti-vortex singularities on the polariton wavefronts, together with an intriguing phenomenon of a traveling wave mimicking the amplitude profile of a standing wave. Our experiments show a 20-fold coherent amplification of the near-field signal compared to conventional electron near-field imaging, resolving peak field intensities of ~W/cm2 (field amplitude of few kV/m). As a result, our work opens a path toward spatio-temporal electron microscopy of biological specimens and quantum materials - exciting yet sensitive samples, which are currently difficult to investigate.},
