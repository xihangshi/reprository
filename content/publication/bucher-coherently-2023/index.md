abstract: Accessing the low-energy non-equilibrium dynamics of materials with simultaneous
  spatial and temporal resolutions has been a bold frontier of electron microscopy
  in recent years. One of the main challenges is the ability to retrieve extremely
  weak signals while simultaneously disentangling amplitude and phase information.
  Here, we present an algorithm-based microscopy approach that uses light-induced
  electron modulation to demonstrate the coherent amplification effect in electron
  imaging of optical near-fields. We provide a simultaneous time-, space-, and phase-resolved
  measurement in a micro-drum made from a hexagonal boron nitride membrane, visualizing
  the sub-cycle spatio-temporal dynamics of 2D polariton wavepackets therein. The
  phase-resolved measurement reveals vortex-anti-vortex singularities on the polariton
  wavefronts, together with an intriguing phenomenon of a traveling wave mimicking
  the amplitude profile of a standing wave. Our experiments show a 20-fold coherent
  amplification of the near-field signal compared to conventional electron near-field
  imaging, resolving peak field intensities of ~W/cm2 (field amplitude of few kV/m).
  As a result, our work opens a path toward spatio-temporal electron microscopy of
  biological specimens and quantum materials - exciting yet sensitive samples, which
  are currently difficult to investigate.
