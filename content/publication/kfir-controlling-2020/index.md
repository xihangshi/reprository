abstract: Free-electron beams are versatile probes of microscopic structure and composition1,2,
  and have revolutionized atomic-scale imaging in several fields, from solid-state
  physics to structural biology3. Over the past decade, the manipulation and interaction
  of electrons with optical fields have enabled considerable progress in imaging methods4,
  near-field electron acceleration5,6, and four-dimensional microscopy techniques
  with high temporal and spatial resolution7. However, electron beams typically couple
  only weakly to optical excitations, and emerging applications in electron control
  and sensing8–11 require large enhancements using tailored fields and interactions.
  Here we couple a free-electron beam to a travelling-wave resonant cavity mode. The
  enhanced interaction with the optical whispering-gallery modes of dielectric microresonators
  induces a strong phase modulation on co-propagating electrons, which leads to a
  spectral broadening of 700 electronvolts, corresponding to the absorption and emission
  of hundreds of photons. By mapping the near-field interaction with ultrashort electron
  pulses in space and time, we trace the lifetime of the the microresonator following
  a femtosecond excitation and observe the spectral response of the cavity. The natural
  matching of free electrons to these quintessential optical modes could enable the
  application of integrated photonics technology in electron microscopy, with broad
  implications for attosecond structuring, probing quantum emitters and possible electron–light
  entanglement.
