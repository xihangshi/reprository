abstract: A short and straightforward method for the conversion of slowly converging
  lattice sums into expressions with good convergence is presented. As an illustration
  a well-known expression for the Madelung constant is rederived. The method is then
  applied to two general types of lattice sums, the latter of which has not been treated
  before.
