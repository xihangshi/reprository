 abstract = {We present a 48-element programmable phase plate for coherent electron waves produced by a combination of photolithography and focused ion beam. This brings the highly successful concept of wavefront shaping from light optics into the realm of electron optics and provides an important new degree of freedom to prepare electron quantum states. The phase plate chip is mounted on an aperture rod placed in the C2 plane of a transmission electron microscope operating in the 100-300 kV range. The phase plate’s behavior is characterized by a Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm, showing a phase sensitivity of 0.075 rad/mV at 300 kV, with a phase resolution of approximately 3\$
