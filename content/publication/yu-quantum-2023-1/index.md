abstract: We present a 48-element programmable phase plate for coherent electron waves
  produced by a combination of photolithography and focused ion beam. This brings
  the highly successful concept of wavefront shaping from light optics into the realm
  of electron optics and provides an important new degree of freedom to prepare electron
  quantum states. The phase plate chip is mounted on an aperture rod placed in the
  C2 plane of a transmission electron microscope operating in the 100-300 kV range.
  The phase plate’s behavior is characterized by a Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm, showing
  a phase sensitivity of 0.075 rad/mV at 300 kV, with a phase resolution of approximately
  3$   10  10    textasciicircum-3 $. In addition, we provide a brief overview of
  possible use cases and support it with both simulated and experimental results.
