abstract: Abstract  Electron and ion beams are indispensable tools in numerous fields
  of science and technology, ranging from radiation therapy to microscopy and lithography.
  Advanced beam control facilitates new functionalities. Here, we report the guiding
  and splitting of charged particle beams using ponderomotive forces created by the
  motion of charged particles through electrostatic optics printed on planar substrates.
  Shape and strength of the potential can be locally tailored by the lithographically
  produced electrodes’ layout and the applied voltages, enabling the control of charged
  particle beams within precisely engineered effective potentials. We demonstrate
  guiding of electrons and ions for a large range of energies (from 20 to 5000 eV)
  and masses (from 5 · 10 −4 to 131 atomic mass units) as well as electron beam splitting
  for energies up to the keV regime as a proof-of-concept for more complex beam manipulation.
