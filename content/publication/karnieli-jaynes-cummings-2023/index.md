abstract: The Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian is at the core of cavity quantum electrodynamics;
  however, it relies on bound-electron emitters fundamentally limited by the binding
  Coulomb potential. In this work, we propose theoretically a new approach to realizing
  the Jaynes-Cummings model using low-energy free electrons coupled to dielectric
  microcavities and exemplify several quantum technologies made possible by this approach.
  Using quantum recoil, a large detuning inhibits the emission of multiple consecutive
  photons, effectively transforming the free electron into a few-level system coupled
  to the cavity mode. We show that this approach can be used for generation of single
  photons, photon pairs, and even a quantum SWAP gate between a photon and a free
  electron, with unity efficiency and high fidelity. Tunable by their kinetic energy,
  quantum free electrons are inherently versatile emitters with an engineerable emission
  wavelength. Hence, they pave the way toward new possibilities for quantum interconnects
  between photonic platforms at disparate spectral regimes. Free electrons coupled
  to optical cavities offer a way to realize the Jaynes-Cummings interaction.
