 abstract = {Abstract Coherent radiation of a relativistic positron (electron) in a crystal is considered in the case of planar channelling. The wave function of the particle is found, the cross-section of the process is calculated, and the evaluation of the radiation intensity is given. The coherent X-ray radiation spectrum is analysed and the observation possibility of the complex and anomalous Doppler effect in this condition is shoun.},
