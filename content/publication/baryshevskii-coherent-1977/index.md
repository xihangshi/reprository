abstract: Abstract Coherent radiation of a relativistic positron (electron) in a crystal
  is considered in the case of planar channelling. The wave function of the particle
  is found, the cross-section of the process is calculated, and the evaluation of
  the radiation intensity is given. The coherent X-ray radiation spectrum is analysed
  and the observation possibility of the complex and anomalous Doppler effect in this
  condition is shoun.
