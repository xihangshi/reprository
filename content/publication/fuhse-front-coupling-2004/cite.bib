 abstract = {A hard x-ray beam of photon energy E=12.5keV has been focused by a Kirkpatrick–Baez mirror system and coupled into the front side of a single-mode x-ray waveguide. The beam dimensions of 3.8×2.5μm2 in the focus of the mirror system have thus been reduced in one direction to 32nm, corresponding to the guiding layer thickness of the waveguide. At the same time the waveguide acts as a coherence filter and leads to a well-defined intensity distribution with steep tails in the near- and far-field regions. The total flux transmitted by the waveguide exceeded 108 photons/s while no significant contributions of radiation transmitted through the absorbing waveguide cladding have been observed.},
