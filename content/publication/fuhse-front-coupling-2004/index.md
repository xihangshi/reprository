abstract: A hard x-ray beam of photon energy E=12.5keV has been focused by a Kirkpatrick–Baez
  mirror system and coupled into the front side of a single-mode x-ray waveguide.
  The beam dimensions of 3.8×2.5μm2 in the focus of the mirror system have thus been
  reduced in one direction to 32nm, corresponding to the guiding layer thickness of
  the waveguide. At the same time the waveguide acts as a coherence filter and leads
  to a well-defined intensity distribution with steep tails in the near- and far-field
  regions. The total flux transmitted by the waveguide exceeded 108 photons/s while
  no significant contributions of radiation transmitted through the absorbing waveguide
  cladding have been observed.
