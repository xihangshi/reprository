abstract: Smith&#x2013;Purcell radiation (SPR) is the electromagnetic wave generated
  by free electrons passing above a diffraction grating, and it has played an important
  role in free-electron light sources and particle accelerators. Orbital angular momentum
  (OAM) is a new degree of freedom that can significantly promote the capacity of
  information carried by an electro-magnetic beam. In this paper, we propose an integrable
  method for generating vortex Smith&#x2013;Purcell radiation (VSPR), namely, SPR
  carrying OAM, by having free-electron bunches pass on planar holographic gratings.
  VSPRs generated by different electron energies, with different topological charges
  of the OAM, radiation angles, and frequencies are demonstrated numerically. It is
  also found that, for high-order radiation, the topological charge of the OAM wave
  will be multiplied by the radiation order. This work introduces a new way to generate
  SPR with OAM and provides a method to achieve an integratable and tunable free-electron
  OAM wave source at different frequency regions.
