abstract: Photons have been a ﬂagship system for studying quantum mechanics, advancing
  quantum information science, and developing quantum technologies. Quantum entanglement,
  teleportation, quantum key distribution, and early quantum computing demonstrations
  were pioneered in this technology because photons represent a naturally mobile and
  low-noise system with quantum-limited detection readily available. The quantum states
  of individual photons can be manipulated with very high precision using interferometry,
  an experimental staple that has been under continuous development since the 19th
  century. The complexity of photonic quantum computing devices and protocol realizations
  has raced ahead as both underlying technologies and theoretical schemes have continued
  to develop. Today, photonic quantum computing represents an exciting path to medium-
  and large-scale processing. It promises to put aside its reputation for requiring
  excessive resource overheads due to inefﬁcient two-qubit gates. Instead, the ability
  to generate large numbers of photons—and the development of integrated platforms,
  improved sources and detectors, novel noise-tolerant theoretical approaches, and
  more—have solidiﬁed it as a leading contender for both quantum information processing
  and quantum networking. Our concise review provides a ﬂyover of some key aspects
  of the ﬁeld, with a focus on experiment. Apart from being a short and accessible
  introduction, its many references to in-depth articles and longer specialist reviews
  serve as a launching point for deeper study of the ﬁeld.
