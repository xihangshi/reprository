 abstract = {We report the first observation of the coupling of strong optical near fields to wavepackets of free, 100 eV electrons with \textless50 fs temporal resolution in an ultrafast point-projection microscope. Optical near fields are created by excitation of a thin, nanometer-sized Yagi-Uda antenna, with 20 fs near-infrared laser pulses. Phase matching between electrons and near fields is achieved due to strong spatial confinement of the antenna near field. Energyresolved projection images of the antenna are recorded in an optical pump−electron probe scheme. We show that the phase modulation of the electron by transverse-field components results in a transient electron deflection while longitudinal near-field components broaden the kinetic energy distribution. This low-energy electron nearfield coupling is used here to characterize the chirp of the ultrafast electron wavepackets, acquired upon propagation from the electron emitter to the sample. Our results bring direct mapping of different vectorial components of highly localized optical near fields into reach.},
