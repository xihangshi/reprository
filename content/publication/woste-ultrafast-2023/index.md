abstract: We report the first observation of the coupling of strong optical near fields
  to wavepackets of free, 100 eV electrons with textless50 fs temporal resolution
  in an ultrafast point-projection microscope. Optical near fields are created by
  excitation of a thin, nanometer-sized Yagi-Uda antenna, with 20 fs near-infrared
  laser pulses. Phase matching between electrons and near fields is achieved due to
  strong spatial confinement of the antenna near field. Energyresolved projection
  images of the antenna are recorded in an optical pump−electron probe scheme. We
  show that the phase modulation of the electron by transverse-field components results
  in a transient electron deflection while longitudinal near-field components broaden
  the kinetic energy distribution. This low-energy electron nearfield coupling is
  used here to characterize the chirp of the ultrafast electron wavepackets, acquired
  upon propagation from the electron emitter to the sample. Our results bring direct
  mapping of different vectorial components of highly localized optical near fields
  into reach.
