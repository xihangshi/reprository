abstract: Quantum information processing requires the generation of indistinguishable
  and coherent particles. While these have been demonstrated for photons, carrying
  it over for electrons and the possibility of quantum electronic implementations
  has been challenging. Using two independent single-electron sources patterned into
  a two-dimensional electron gas, Bocquillon et al. (p. 1054, published online 24
  January; see the Perspective by Schönenberger) performed single-electron interference
  experiments. The results demonstrate that the generated electrons can possess the
  desired properties for potential quantum applications. The interference of single
  electrons emitted from independent sources is demonstrated. [Also see Perspective
  by Schönenberger] The on-demand emission of coherent and indistinguishable electrons
  by independent synchronized sources is a challenging task of quantum electronics,
  in particular regarding its application for quantum information processing. Using
  two independent on-demand electron sources, we triggered the emission of two single-electron
  wave packets at different inputs of an electronic beam splitter. Whereas classical
  particles would be randomly partitioned by the splitter, we observed two-particle
  interference resulting from quantum exchange. Both electrons, emitted in indistinguishable
  wave packets with synchronized arrival time on the splitter, exited in different
  outputs as recorded by the low-frequency current noise. The demonstration of two-electron
  interference provides the possibility of manipulating coherent and indistinguishable
  single-electron wave packets in quantum conductors.
