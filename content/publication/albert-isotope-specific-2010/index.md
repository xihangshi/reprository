abstract: What we believe to be the first demonstration of isotope-specific detection
  of a low-Z and low density object shielded by a high-Z and high-density material
  using monoenergetic gamma rays is reported. The isotope-specific detection of LiH
  shielded by Pb and Al is accomplished using the nuclear resonance fluorescence line
  of L7i at 478 keV. Resonant photons are produced via laser-based Compton scattering.
  The detection techniques are general, and the confidence level obtained is shown
  to be superior to that yielded by conventional x-ray and Î³-ray techniques in these
  situations.
