abstract: We present a performance evaluation of a recently introduced dual-source
  computed tomography (DSCT) system equipped with two X-ray tubes and two corresponding
  detectors, mounted onto the rotating gantry with an angular offset of 90°. We introduce
  the system concept and derive its consequences and potential benefits for echocardiograph
  (ECG)-controlled cardiac CT and for general radiology applications. We evaluate
  both temporal and spatial resolution by means of phantom scans. We present first
  patient scans to illustrate the performance of DSCT for ECG-gated cardiac imaging,
  and we demonstrate first results using a dual-energy acquisition mode. Using ECG-gated
  single-segment reconstruction, the DSCT system provides 83 ms temporal resolution
  independent of the patient's heart rate for coronary CT angiography (CTA) and evaluation
  of basic functional parameters. With dual-segment reconstruction, the mean temporal
  resolution is 60 ms (minimum temporal resolution 42 ms) for advanced functional
  evaluation. The z-flying focal spot technique implemented in the evaluated DSCT
  system allows 0.4 mm cylinders to be resolved at all heart rates. First clinical
  experience shows a considerably increased robustness for the imaging of patients
  with high heart rates. As a potential application of the dual-energy acquisition
  mode, the automatic separation of bones and iodine-filled vessels is demonstrated.
