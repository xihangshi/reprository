 abstract = {We present a performance evaluation of a recently introduced dual-source computed tomography (DSCT) system equipped with two X-ray tubes and two corresponding detectors, mounted onto the rotating gantry with an angular offset of 90°. We introduce the system concept and derive its consequences and potential benefits for echocardiograph (ECG)-controlled cardiac CT and for general radiology applications. We evaluate both temporal and spatial resolution by means of phantom scans. We present first patient scans to illustrate the performance of DSCT for ECG-gated cardiac imaging, and we demonstrate first results using a dual-energy acquisition mode. Using ECG-gated single-segment reconstruction, the DSCT system provides 83 ms temporal resolution independent of the patient's heart rate for coronary CT angiography (CTA) and evaluation of basic functional parameters. With dual-segment reconstruction, the mean temporal resolution is 60 ms (minimum temporal resolution 42 ms) for advanced functional evaluation. The z-flying focal spot technique implemented in the evaluated DSCT system allows 0.4 mm cylinders to be resolved at all heart rates. First clinical experience shows a considerably increased robustness for the imaging of patients with high heart rates. As a potential application of the dual-energy acquisition mode, the automatic separation of bones and iodine-filled vessels is demonstrated. © Springer-Verlag 2005.},
