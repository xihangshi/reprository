 abstract = {We developed a transportable micro-XRF (μ-XRF) spectrometer using a polycapillary X-ray focusing half lens, which was placed between the sample and the detector. The total weight of the developed spectrometer was about 2 kg; its dimensions were 18 (W) × 26 (D) × 40 (H) cm. The spatial resolution of the spectrometer with the half lens of a working (focal) distance of 30 mm was 171 μ mat Fe Kα, which was evaluated by a wire scanning method. In this setup, it is easy to replace the polycapillary X-ray half lens with one having a different analytical performance, because a precise position-adjustment of the X-ray lens is not required. The spacial resolution with the half lens of a working distance of 16 mm was 106 μ mat Fe Kα. Depending on analyzing area on the sample and required spatial resolution, we can easily change the X-ray lens, as in a conventional optical microscope. The calibration curves of V, Cr, Mn, and Ni measured for standard steel materials showed good linear relationships (correlation coefficients \textgreater0.993). Clear elemental mapping could be obtained by scanning the sample (Cu mesh). An elemental analysis of a micro-region in an electronic device was also performed by the transportable μ-XRF spectrometer. Sn and Pb were detected at the metallic part (Sn-Pb solder) of the device. Br and Ba were observed at some resin parts of the electronic device. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},
