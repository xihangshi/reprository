abstract: Advances in the research of interactions between ultrafast free electrons
  and light have introduced a previously unknown kind of quantum matter, quantum free-electron
  wavepackets1–5. So far, studies of the interactions of cavity-confined light with
  quantum matter have focused on bound electron systems, such as atoms, quantum dots
  and quantum circuits, which are considerably limited by their fixed energy states,
  spectral range and selection rules. By contrast, quantum free-electron wavepackets
  have no such limits, but so far no experiment has shown the influence of a photonic
  cavity on quantum free-electron wavepackets. Here we develop a platform for multidimensional
  nanoscale imaging and spectroscopy of free-electron interactions with photonic cavities.
  We directly measure the cavity-photon lifetime via a coherent free-electron probe
  and observe an enhancement of more than an order of magnitude in the interaction
  strength relative to previous experiments of electron–photon interactions. Our free-electron
  probe resolves the spatiotemporal and energy–momentum information of the interaction.
  The quantum nature of the electrons is verified by spatially mapping Rabi oscillations
  of the electron spectrum. The interactions between free electrons and cavity photons
  could enable low-dose, ultrafast electron microscopy of soft matter or other beam-sensitive
  materials. Such interactions may also open paths towards using free electrons for
  quantum information processing and quantum sensing. Future studies could achieve
  free-electron strong coupling6,7, photon quantum state synthesis8 and quantum nonlinear
  phenomena such as cavity electro-optomechanics9.
