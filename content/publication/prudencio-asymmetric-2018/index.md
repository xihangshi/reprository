abstract: Here, we investigate the Cherenkov emission by an array of moving electric
  charges in the vicinity of a topologically nontrivial gyrotropic material. It is
  shown that the nonreciprocal material response may result in a robustly asymmetric
  Cherenkov emission, such that the spectrum of the emitted radiation and the stopping
  power depend strongly on the sign of the particle velocity. It is demonstrated that
  the main emission channels are determined by the unidirectional edge states supported
  by the topological material. We consider as examples both magnetized plasmas and
  Weyl semimetals. The latter may exhibit a spontaneous nonreciprocal response without
  a biasing magnetic field. © 2018 American Physical Society.
