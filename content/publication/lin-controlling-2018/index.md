abstract: Cherenkov radiation provides a valuable way to identify high-energy particles
  in a wide momentum range, through the relation between the particle velocity and
  the Cherenkov angle. However, since the Cherenkov angle depends only on the material’s
  permittivity, the material unavoidably sets a fundamental limit to the momentum
  coverage and sensitivity of Cherenkov detectors. For example, ring-imaging Cherenkov
  detectors must employ materials transparent to the frequency of interest as well
  as possessing permittivities close to unity to identify particles in the multi-gigaelectronvolt
  range, and thus are often limited to large gas chambers. It would be extremely important,
  albeit challenging, to lift this fundamental limit and control Cherenkov angles
  at will. Here we propose a new mechanism that uses the constructive interference
  of resonance transition radiation from photonic crystals to generate both forward
  and backward effective Cherenkov radiation. This mechanism can control the radiation
  angles in a flexible way with high sensitivity to any desired range of velocities.
  Photonic crystals thus overcome the material limit for Cherenkov detectors, enabling
  the use of transparent materials with arbitrary values of permittivity, and provide
  a promising versatile platform well suited for identification of particles at high
  energy with enhanced sensitivity.
