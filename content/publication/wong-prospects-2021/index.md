abstract: "The science of x-rays is by now over 125years old, starting with Wilhelm
  Röntgen's discovery of x-rays in 1895, for which Röntgen was awarded the first Nobel
  Prize in Physics. X-rays have fundamentally changed the world in areas, including
  medical imaging, security scanners, industrial inspection, materials development,
  and drugs spectroscopy. X-ray science has been so far responsible for over 25 Nobel
  Prizes in Physics, Chemistry, and Medicine/Physiology. With x-ray generation being
  a highly commercialized, widely adopted technology, it may appear that there is
  little left to discover regarding the fundamentals of x-ray science. Contrary to
  this notion, recent years have shown renewed interest in the research and development
  of innovative x-ray concepts. We highlight, in this Perspective, promising directions
  for future research in x-ray science that result from advances in quantum science
  and in nanomaterials. Specifically, we describe three key opportunities for advancing
  x-ray science in the near future: (1) emerging material platforms for x-ray generation,
  especially 2D materials and their heterostructures; (2) free-electron-driven emission
  of entangled photon-photon and electron-photon pairs for x-ray quantum optics; and
  (3) shaping free-electron wavepackets for controllable x-ray emission. These research
  directions could lead to improvements in x-ray resonance fluoroscopy, high-contrast
  x-ray imaging, stimulated coherent x rays, x-ray superradiance, and other prospects
  for x-ray quantum optics."
