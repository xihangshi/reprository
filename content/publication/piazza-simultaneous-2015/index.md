abstract: Surface plasmon polaritons can confine electromagnetic fields in subwavelength
  spaces and are of interest for photonics, optical data storage devices and biosensing
  applications. In analogy to photons, they exhibit wave-particle duality, whose different
  aspects have recently been observed in separate tailored experiments. Here we demonstrate
  the ability of ultrafast transmission electron microscopy to simultaneously image
  both the spatial interference and the quantization of such confined plasmonic fields.
  Our experiments are accomplished by spatiotemporally overlapping electron and light
  pulses on a single nanowire suspended on a graphene film. The resulting energy exchange
  between single electrons and the quanta of the photoinduced near-field is imaged
  synchronously with its spatial interference pattern. This methodology enables the
  control and visualization of plasmonic fields at the nanoscale, providing a promising
  tool for understanding the fundamental properties of confined electromagnetic fields
  and the development of advanced photonic circuits.
