abstract: We report the field-emission properties of ultrathin tungsten nanowires
  of 5nm diameter and several hundred nanometer length. Fowler-Nordheim plots of field-emission
  current-voltage measurements of such nanowires show marked deviation from linearity.
  After flashing, cold-field-emission current stability with standard deviation of
  better than 1% has been observed for periods of at least 30min at a vacuum level
  of 10−9mbar. Beyond this, field-emission current noise was found to mainly comprise
  current step jumps and current spikes. At high emission current densities in the
  order of 106Acm−2, the noise changes into flicker noise. Field emission at high
  current density induced surface diffusion and crystallization of the disordered
  nanowire tip due to temperature rise at the field-emitting tip. Further increase
  in the emission current density initiated local arc destruction which caused shortening
  of the nanowire length.
