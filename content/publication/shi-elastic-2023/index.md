abstract: Free-electron radiation phenomena are treated almost exclusively with classical
  electrodynamics, despite the intrinsic interaction being that of quantum electrodynamics.
  The lack of quantumness arises from the vast disparity between the electron energy
  and the much smaller photon energy, creating a small cross-section that makes quantum
  effects negligible. Here we identify a fundamentally distinct phenomenon of electron
  radiation that bypasses this energy disparity, and thus displays extremely strong
  quantum features. This phenomenon arises from free-electron elastic recoil, which
  can influence fundamental radiation processes in ways thought so far to necessitate
  inelastic scattering. The underlying reason for the quantum radiation features,
  which have no counterparts in classical theory, is the entanglement between each
  elastically recoiled electron and the photons it emitted. We show that this phenomenon
  is more accessible than all other types of quantum features in free-electron radiation
  and can be detected in current experimental setups such as electron microscopes.
  These quantum radiation features could guide the development of compact coherent
  X-ray sources facilitated by nanophotonics and quantum optics.
