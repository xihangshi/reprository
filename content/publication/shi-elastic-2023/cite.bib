 abstract = {Free-electron radiation phenomena are treated almost exclusively with classical electrodynamics, despite the intrinsic interaction being that of quantum electrodynamics. The lack of quantumness arises from the vast disparity between the electron energy and the much smaller photon energy, creating a small cross-section that makes quantum effects negligible. Here we identify a fundamentally distinct phenomenon of electron radiation that bypasses this energy disparity, and thus displays extremely strong quantum features. This phenomenon arises from free-electron elastic recoil, which can influence fundamental radiation processes in ways thought so far to necessitate inelastic scattering. The underlying reason for the quantum radiation features, which have no counterparts in classical theory, is the entanglement between each elastically recoiled electron and the photons it emitted. We show that this phenomenon is more accessible than all other types of quantum features in free-electron radiation and can be detected in current experimental setups such as electron microscopes. These quantum radiation features could guide the development of compact coherent X-ray sources facilitated by nanophotonics and quantum optics.},
