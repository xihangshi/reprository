 abstract = {Based on a perturbative solution of Maxwell's equations in crystal, an analytic expression for the coherent radiation from relativistic electrons in a crystal observed recently (called “parametric X-ray radiation”) has been derived. The mechanism of the radiation process is clearly shown by using dispersion surfaces.},
