abstract: Based on a perturbative solution of Maxwell's equations in crystal, an analytic
  expression for the coherent radiation from relativistic electrons in a crystal observed
  recently (called “parametric X-ray radiation”) has been derived. The mechanism of
  the radiation process is clearly shown by using dispersion surfaces.
