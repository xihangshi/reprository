abstract: Time-resolved electron diffraction harbors great promise for resolving the
  fastest chemical processes with atomic level detail. The main obstacles to achieving
  this real-time view of a chemical reaction are associated with delivering short
  electron pulses with sufficient electron density to the sample. In this article,
  the propagation dynamics of femtosecond electron packets in the drift region of
  a photoelectron gun are investigated with an N-body numerical simulation and mean-field
  model. It is found that space-charge effects can broaden the electron pulse to many
  times its original length and generate many eV of kinetic energy bandwidth in only
  a few nanoseconds. There is excellent agreement between the N-body simulation and
  the mean-field model for both space-charge induced temporal and kinetic energy distribution
  broadening. The numerical simulation also shows that the redistribution of electrons
  inside the packet results in changes to the pulse envelope and the development of
  a spatially linear axial velocity distribution. These results are important for
  (or have the potential to impact on) the interpretation of time-resolved electron
  diffraction experiments and can be used in the design of photoelectron guns and
  streak tubes with temporal resolution of several hundred femtoseconds.
