abstract: Information can be encoded using various properties of light. Optical multiplexing
  frequency, brightness, and polarization have played crucial roles in information
  technologies, high-capacity data storage, high-speed communications, and biological
  sensing. Angular momentum is another degree of freedom that could increase capacity
  further. Typically, however, the bulk optical elements used to determine the angular
  momentum of light limit possible on-chip processing. Ren et al. take a nanophotonics
  approach to measure and sort light co-propagating with different states of angular
  momentum (see the Perspective by Molina-Terriza). The approach is promising for
  on-chip multiplex processing of optical signals.Science, this issue p. 805; see
  also p. 774Angular momentum division has emerged as a physically orthogonal multiplexing
  method in high-capacity optical information technologies. However, the typical bulky
  elements used for information retrieval from the overall diffracted field, based
  on the interference method, impose a fundamental limit toward realizing on-chip
  multiplexing. We demonstrate noninterference angular momentum multiplexing by using
  a mode-sorting nanoring aperture with a chip-scale footprint as small as 4.2 micrometers
  by 4.2 micrometers, where nanoring slits exhibit a distinctive outcoupling efficiency
  on tightly confined plasmonic modes. The nonresonant mode-sorting sensitivity and
  scalability of our approach enable on-chip parallel multiplexing over a bandwidth
  of 150 nanometers in the visible wavelength range. The results offer the possibility
  of ultrahigh-capacity and miniaturized nanophotonic devices harnessing angular momentum
  division.
