abstract: A semiconductor injection laser that differs in a fundamental way from diode
  lasers has been demonstrated. It is built out of quantum semiconductor structures
  that were grown by molecular beam epitaxy and designed by band structure engineering.
  Electrons streaming down a potential staircase sequentially emit photons at the
  steps. The steps consist of coupled quantum wells in which population inversion
  between discrete conduction band excited states is achieved by control of tunneling.
  A strong narrowing of the emission spectrum, above threshold, provides direct evidence
  of laser action at a wavelength of 4.2 micrometers with peak powers in excess of
  8 milliwatts in pulsed operation. In quantum cascade lasers, the wavelength, entirely
  determined by quantum confinement, can be tailored from the mid-infrared to the
  submillimeter wave region in the same heterostructure material.
