abstract: The coupled dipole approximation method was formulated by Purcell and Pennypacker
  to treat scattering by irregular bodies, and it has gained considerable currency
  in the recent past. Since the heuristic formulation of the method has a semi-microscopic
  flavour, here it has been given a firm macroscopic foundation by connecting it with
  volume integral equations. This communication also serves as a mini-review of the
  recent developments of this numerical technique.
