 abstract = {The coupled dipole approximation method was formulated by Purcell and Pennypacker to treat scattering by irregular bodies, and it has gained considerable currency in the recent past. Since the heuristic formulation of the method has a semi-microscopic flavour, here it has been given a firm macroscopic foundation by connecting it with volume integral equations. This communication also serves as a mini-review of the recent developments of this numerical technique.},
