abstract: Free-electron radiation such as Cerenkov(1), Smith-Purcell(2) and transition
  radiation(3,4) can be greatly affected by structured optical environments, as has
  been demonstrated in a variety of polaritonic(5,6), photonic-crystal(7) and metamaterial(8-10)
  systems. However, the amount of radiation that can ultimately be extracted from
  free electrons near an arbitrary material structure has remained elusive. Here we
  derive a fundamental upper limit to the spontaneous photon emission and energy loss
  of free electrons, regardless of geometry, which illuminates the effects of material
  properties and electron velocities. We obtain experimental evidence for our theory
  with quantitative measurements of Smith-Purcell radiation. Our framework allows
  us to make two predictions. One is a new regime of radiation operation-at subwavelength
  separations, slower (non-relativistic) electrons can achieve stronger radiation
  than fast (relativistic) electrons. The other is a divergence of the emission probability
  in the limit of loss-less materials. We further reveal that such divergences can
  be approached by coupling free electrons to photonic bound states in the continuum(11-13).
  Our findings suggest that compact and efficient free-electron radiation sources
  from microwaves to the soft X-ray regime may be achievable without requiring ultrahigh
  accelerating voltages.
