abstract: Although two-dimensional (2D) atomic layers, such as transition-metal chalcogenides,
  have been widely synthesized using techniques such as exfoliation1–3 and vapour-phase
  growth4,5, it is still challenging to obtain phase-controlled 2D structures6–8.
  Here we demonstrate an effective synthesis strategy via the progressive transformation
  of non-van der Waals (non-vdW) solids to 2D vdW transition-metal chalcogenide layers
  with identified 2H (trigonal prismatic)/1T (octahedral) phases. The transformation,
  achieved by exposing non-vdW solids to chalcogen vapours, can be controlled using
  the enthalpies and vapour pressures of the reaction products. Heteroatom-substituted
  (such as yttrium and phosphorus) transition-metal chalcogenides can also be synthesized
  in this way, thus enabling a generic synthesis approach to engineering phase-selected
  2D transition-metal chalcogenide structures with good stability at high temperatures
  (up to 1,373 kelvin) and achieving high-throughput production of monolayers. We
  anticipate that these 2D transition-metal chalcogenides will have broad applications
  for electronics, catalysis and energy storage.
