abstract: Field emission of electrons underlies great advances in science and technology,
  ranging from signal processing at ever higher frequencies1 to imaging of the atomic-scale
  structure of matter2 with picometre resolution. The advancing of electron microscopy
  techniques to enable the complete visualization of matter on the native spatial
  (picometre) and temporal (attosecond) scales of electron dynamics calls for techniques
  that can confine and examine the field emission on sub-femtosecond time intervals.
  Intense laser pulses have paved the way to this end3,4 by demonstrating femtosecond
  confinement5,6 and sub-optical cycle control7,8 of the optical field emission9 from
  nanostructured metals. Yet the measurement of attosecond electron pulses has remained
  elusive. We used intense, sub-cycle light transients to induce optical field emission
  of electron pulses from tungsten nanotips and a weak replica of the same transient
  to directly investigate the emission dynamics in real time. Access to the temporal
  properties of the electron pulses rescattering off the tip surface, including the
  duration τ = (53 as ± 5 as) and chirp, and the direct exploration of nanoscale near
  fields open new prospects for research and applications at the interface of attosecond
  physics and nano-optics.
