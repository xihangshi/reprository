abstract: Recent progress in nanofabrication, namely of multilayer optics, and the
  construction of coherent hard x-ray sources has enabled high resolution x-ray microscopy
  with large numerical aperture optics for small focal spot sizes. Sub-10 nm and even
  sub-5 nm focal spot sizes have already been achieved using multilayer optics such
  as multilayer Laue lenses and multilayer zone plates. However these optics can not
  be described by the kinematic theory given their extreme aspect-ratio between the
  depth (thickness) and the layer width. Moreover, the numerical simulation of these
  optics is challenging, and the absence of an accessible numerical framework inhibits
  further progress in their design and utilization. Here, we simulate the propagation
  of x-ray wavefields within and behind optical multilayer elements using a finite-difference
  propagation method. We show that the method offers high accuracy at reasonable computational
  cost. We investigate how small focal spot sizes and highest diffraction efficiency
  of multilayer optics can be achieved, considering volume diffraction effects such
  as waveguiding and Pendell√∂sung. Finally, we show the simulation of a novel imaging
  scheme, allowing for a detailed study of image formation and the development of
  customized phase retrieval schemes.
