abstract: Parametric X radiation (PXR) produced by electrons with an energy of (Formula
  presented) interacting with the atoms in the (220) plane of a (Formula presented)
  silicon and a (Formula presented) diamond crystal and observed at an angle of (Formula
  presented) by a Si(Li) detector has been investigated with respect to the interference
  with coherent bremsstrahlung (CB) that originates in the same interaction process
  between the incoming relativistic electron and the crystal. Since the energy of
  PXR and CB is identical, contributions of both types of radiation are indistinguishable.
  The newly derived analytical expressions describe the radiation which consists of
  a coherent superposition of PXR and CB. For the comparison of the experimental results
  with the theoretical predictions a Monte Carlo simulation taking into account all
  effects accompanying the radiation process has been performed. The comparison shows
  very good agreement between experiment and theory. Â© 2000 The American Physical
