abstract: X-ray refraction related interaction has received rising interest since
  about two decades in the field of imaging, beam shaping and analysis although being
  discovered a century ago. Due to refraction at interfaces in inhomogeneous media
  X-rays undergo natural focusing (or defocusing) of waves, revealing caustics. Such
  kind of intensity patterns are well-known for visible light, but have been sparsely
  discussed for X-rays. The variation of irradiation density may be predicted in case
  of known shapes. Analogously to light optics, the intensity distributions cover
  several orders of magnitude including complete extinction. The partly convergent
  (and divergent) caustic stripes originate from narrow zones of typical size of some
  10−6 of the boundary curvature radius. For the deflection of plane wave synchrotron
  radiation (energy in the range of some keV to some ten keV) at rods and tubes of
  several μm diameter, we find good agreement between experiments and modeling by
  ray tracing according to Snell's law without additional diffraction contributions.
  Apart from basic research implications, caustics may influence the performance of
  irradiation technologies such as sterilization or molecular cross-linking.
