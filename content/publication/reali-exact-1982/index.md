abstract: This analysis provides a manageable extinction theorem from which the exact
  solution of the basic equations of molecular optics is obtained for the problem
  of refraction and reflection of an electromagnetic wave (for simplicity, taken to
  be a plane one) that is incident upon a linear, homogeneous, isotropic, nonmagnetic
  dielectric filling a half-space. The method developed may be useful to resolve the
  fields in a nonlinear material as well as for other problems in which the interaction
  of an electromagnetic wave and a dielectric medium is concerned.
