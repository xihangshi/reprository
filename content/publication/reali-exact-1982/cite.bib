 abstract = {This analysis provides a manageable extinction theorem from which the exact solution of the basic equations of molecular optics is obtained for the problem of refraction and reflection of an electromagnetic wave (for simplicity, taken to be a plane one) that is incident upon a linear, homogeneous, isotropic, nonmagnetic dielectric filling a half-space. The method developed may be useful to resolve the fields in a nonlinear material as well as for other problems in which the interaction of an electromagnetic wave and a dielectric medium is concerned.},
