abstract: The linear polarization of Parametric X-radiation (PXR) produced by 80.5
  MeV electrons in a 13 μm thick silicon single crystal has been analyzed by means
  of a novel method of polarimetry exploiting directional information of the photoeffect
  in a charge coupled device consisting of 1.3 × 106 square pixels of 6.8 μm. The
  experiment was carried out at the Darmstadt superconducting linear accelerator S-DALINAC
  providing a low-emittance electron beam. The linear polarization of the (2 2 0)
  reflection observed in eight narrow angular bins between 20 ° and 21 ° with respect
  to the electron beam direction is consistent with complete local linear polarization.
  The orientation of the polarization plane, within measurement errors of typically
  10 °, varies over the diffraction pattern in such a way as to be expected from kinematical
  theory. The result of this experiment is in contradiction to the only other PXR
  polarization measurement performed so far. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights
