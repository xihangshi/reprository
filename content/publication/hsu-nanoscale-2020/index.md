abstract: The existence of nontrivial Berry phases associated with two inequivalent
  valleys in graphene provides interesting opportunities for investigating the valley-projected
  topological states. Examples of such studies include observation of anomalous quantum
  Hall effect in monolayer graphene, demonstration of topological zero modes in “molecular
  graphene” assembled by scanning tunneling microscopy, and detection of topological
  valley transport either in graphene superlattices or at bilayer graphene domain
  walls. However, all aforementioned experiments involved nonscalable approaches of
  either mechanically exfoliated flakes or atom-by-atom constructions. Here, we report
  an approach to manipulating the topological states in monolayer graphene via nanoscale
  strain engineering at room temperature. By placing strain-free monolayer graphene
  on architected nanostructures to induce global inversion symmetry breaking, we demonstrate
  the development of giant pseudo-magnetic fields (up to ~800 T), valley polarization,
  and periodic one-dimensional topological channels for protected propagation of chiral
  modes in strained graphene, thus paving a pathway toward scalable graphene-based
  valleytronics.
