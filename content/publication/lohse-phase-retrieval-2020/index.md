abstract: Propagation-based phase-contrast X-ray imaging is by now a well established
  imaging technique, which – as a full-field technique – is particularly useful for
  tomography applications. Since it can be implemented with synchrotron radiation
  and at laboratory micro-focus sources, it covers a wide range of applications. A
  limiting factor in its development has been the phase-retrieval step, which was
  often performed using methods with a limited regime of applicability, typically
  based on linearization. In this work, a much larger set of algorithms, which covers
  a wide range of cases (experimental parameters, objects and constraints), is compiled
  into a single toolbox – the HoloTomoToolbox – which is made publicly available.
  Importantly, the unified structure of the implemented phase-retrieval functions
  facilitates their use and performance test on different experimental data.
