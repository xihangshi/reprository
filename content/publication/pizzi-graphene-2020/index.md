abstract: Abstract The interaction of electrons with strong electromagnetic fields
  is fundamental to the ability to design high-quality radiation sources. At the core
  of all such sources is a tradeoff between compactness and higher output radiation
  intensities. Conventional photonic devices are limited in size by their operating
  wavelength, which helps compactness at the cost of a small interaction area. Here,
  plasmonic modes supported by multilayer graphene metamaterials are shown to provide
  a larger interaction area with the electron beam, while also tapping into the extreme
  confinement of graphene plasmons to generate high-frequency photons with relatively
  low-energy electrons available from tabletop sources. For 5 MeV electrons, a metamaterial
  of 50 layers and length 50 µm, and a beam current of 1.7 µA, it is, for instance,
  possible to generate X-rays of intensity 1.5 ? 107 photons sr?1 s?1 1%BW, 580 times
  more than for a single-layer design. The frequency of the driving laser dynamically
  tunes the photon emission spectrum. This work demonstrates a unique free-electron
  light source, wherein the electron mean free path in a given material is longer
  than the device length, relaxing the requirements of complex electron beam systems
  and potentially paving the way to high-yield, compact, and tunable X-ray sources.
