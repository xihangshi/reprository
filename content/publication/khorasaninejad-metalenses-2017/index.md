abstract: 'Recent progress in metasurface designs fueled by advanced-fabrication techniques
  has led to the realization of ultrathin, lightweight, and flat lenses (metalenses)
  with unprecedented functionalities. Owing to straightforward fabrication, generally
  requiring a single-step lithography, and the possibility of vertical integration,
  these planar lenses can potentially replace or complement their conventional refractive
  and diffractive counterparts, leading to further miniaturization of high-performance
  optical devices and systems. Here we provide a brief overview of the evolution of
  metalenses, with an emphasis on the visible and near-infrared spectrum, and summarize
  their important features: diffraction-limited focusing, high-quality imaging, and
  multifunctionalities. We discuss impending challenges, including aberration correction,
  and also examine current issues and solutions. We conclude by providing an outlook
  of this technology platform and identifying promising directions for future research.'
