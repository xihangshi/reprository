abstract: In X-ray holographic near-field imaging the resolution and image quality
  depend sensitively on the beam. Artifacts are often encountered due to the strong
  focusing required to reach high resolution. Here, two schemes for reconstructing
  the complex-valued and extended wavefront of X-ray nano-probes, primarily in the
  planes relevant for imaging ( i.e. focus, sample and detection plane), are presented
  and compared. Firstly, near-field ptychography is used, based on scanning a test
  pattern laterally as well as longitudinally along the optical axis. Secondly, any
  test pattern is dispensed of and the wavefront reconstructed only from data recorded
  for different longitudinal translations of the detector. For this purpose, an optimized
  multi-plane projection algorithm is presented, which can cope with the numerically
  very challenging setting of a divergent wavefront emanating from a hard X-ray nanoprobe.
  The results of both schemes are in very good agreement. The probe retrieval can
  be used as a tool for optics alignment, in particular at X-ray nanoprobe beamlines.
  Combining probe retrieval and object reconstruction is also shown to improve the
  image quality of holographic near-field imaging.
