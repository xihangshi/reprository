abstract: The electronic bandgap is an intrinsic property of semiconductors and insulators
  that largely determines their transport and optical properties. As such, it has
  a central role in modern device physics and technology and governs the operation
  of semiconductor devices such as p-n junctions, transistors, photodiodes and lasers.
  A tunable bandgap would be highly desirable because it would allow great flexibility
  in design and optimization of such devices, in particular if it could be tuned by
  applying a variable external electric field. However, in conventional materials,
  the bandgap is fixed by their crystalline structure, preventing such bandgap control.
  Here we demonstrate the realization of a widely tunable electronic bandgap in electrically
  gated bilayer graphene. Using a dual-gate bilayer graphene field-effect transistor
  (FET) and infrared microspectroscopy, we demonstrate a gate-controlled, continuously
  tunable bandgap of up to 250meV. Our technique avoids uncontrolled chemical doping
  and provides direct evidence of a widely tunable bandgapspanning a spectral range
  from zero to mid-infraredthat has eluded previous attempts. Combined with the remarkable
  electrical transport properties of such systems, this electrostatic bandgap control
  suggests novel nanoelectronic and nanophotonic device applications based on graphene.
