abstract: The highly engineerable scattering properties of resonant optical antennas
  underpin the operation of metasurface-based flat optics. Thus far, the choice of
  antenna has been limited to shaped metallic and high-index semiconductor nanostructures
  that support geometrical plasmonic or Mie resonances. Whereas these resonant elements
  offer strong light–matter interaction and excellent control over the scattering
  phase and amplitude, their electrical tunability has proven to be quite limited.
  Here, we demonstrate how excitonic resonances in atomically thin semiconductors
  can be harnessed as a different, third type of resonance to create mutable, flat
  optics. These strong materials-based resonances are unmatched in their tunability
  with various external stimuli. To illustrate the concept, we first demonstrate how
  excitons can enhance the focusing efficiency of a millimetre-scale, patterned WS2
  zone plate lens. We also show how electrical gating can completely turn on and off
  the exciton resonance and thereby modulate the focusing efficiency by 33%.
