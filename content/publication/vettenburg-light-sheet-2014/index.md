abstract: Light-sheet microscopy facilitates rapid, high-contrast, volumetric imaging
  with minimal sample exposure. However, the rapid divergence of a traditional Gaussian
  light sheet restricts the field of view (FOV) that provides innate subcellular resolution.
  We show that the Airy beam innately yields high contrast and resolution up to a
  tenfold larger FOV. In contrast to the Bessel beam, which also provides an increased
  FOV, the Airy beam's characteristic asymmetric excitation pattern results in all
  fluorescence contributing positively to the contrast, enabling a step change for
  light-sheet microscopy. © 2014 Nature America, Inc.
