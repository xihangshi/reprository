abstract: The novel quantum effects induced by the free-electron–photons interaction
  have attracted increasing interest due to their potential applications in ultrafast
  quantum information processing. Here, we propose a scheme to generate optical cat
  states based on the quantum interference of multi-path free-electron–photons interactions
  that take place simultaneously with strong coupling strength. By performing a projection
  measurement on the electron, the state of light changes significantly from a coherent
  state into a non-Gaussian state with either Wigner negativity or squeezing property,
  both possess metrological power to achieve quantum advantage. More importantly,
  we show that the Wigner negativity oscillates with the coupling strength, and the
  optical cat states are successfully generated with high fidelity at all the oscillation
  peaks. This oscillation reveals the quantum interference effect of the multiple
  quantum pathways in the interaction of the electron with photons, by that various
  nonclassical states of light are promising to be fast prepared and manipulated.
  These findings inspire further exploration of emergent quantum phenomena and advanced
  quantum technologies with free electrons.
