abstract: 'The physics of intense laser–matter interactions1,2 is described by treating
  the light pulses classically, anticipating no need to access optical measurements
  beyond the classical limit. However, the quantum nature of the electromagnetic fields
  is always present3. Here we demonstrate that intense laser–atom interactions may
  lead to the generation of highly non-classical light states. This was achieved by
  using the process of high-harmonic generation in atoms4,5, in which the photons
  of a driving laser pulse of infrared frequency are upconverted into photons of higher
  frequencies in the extreme ultraviolet spectral range. The quantum state of the
  fundamental mode after the interaction, when conditioned on the high-harmonic generation,
  is a so-called Schrödinger cat state, which corresponds to a superposition of two
  distinct coherent states: the initial state of the laser and the coherent state
  reduced in amplitude that results from the interaction with atoms. The results open
  the path for investigations towards the control of the non-classical states, exploiting
  conditioning approaches on physical processes relevant to high-harmonic generation.'
