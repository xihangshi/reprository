abstract: Abstract Inelastic interaction of free-electrons with optical near fields
  has recently attracted attention for manipulating and shaping free-electron wavepackets.
  Understanding the nature and the dependence of the inelastic cross section on the
  polarization of the optical near-field is important for both fundamental aspects
  and the development of new applications in quantum-sensitive measurements. Here,
  we investigate the effect of the polarization and the spatial profile of plasmonic
  near-field distributions on shaping free-electrons and controlling the energy transfer
  mechanisms, but also tailoring the electron recoil. We particularly show that polarization
  of the exciting light can be used as a control knop for disseminating the acceleration
  and deceleration path ways via the experienced electron recoil. We also demonstrate
  the possibility of tailoring the shape of the localized plasmons by incorporating
  specific arrangements of nanorods to enhance or hamper the transversal and longitudinal
  recoils of free-electrons. Our findings open up a route towards plasmonic near-fields-engineering
  for the coherent manipulation and control of slow electron beams for creating desired
  shapes of electron wavepackets.
