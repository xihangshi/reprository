abstract: Current X-ray imaging technologies involving flat-panel detectors have difficulty
  in imaging three-dimensional objects because fabrication of large-area, flexible,
  silicon-based photodetectors on highly curved surfaces remains a challenge1â€“3. Here
  we demonstrate ultralong-lived X-ray trapping for flat-panel-free, high-resolution,
  three-dimensional imaging using a series of solution-processable, lanthanide-doped
  nanoscintillators. Corroborated by quantum mechanical simulations of defect formation
  and electronic structures, our experimental characterizations reveal that slow hopping
  of trapped electrons due to radiation-triggered anionic migration in host lattices
  can induce more than 30 days of persistent radioluminescence. We further demonstrate
  X-ray luminescence extension imaging with resolution greater than 20 line pairs
  per millimetre and optical memory longer than 15 days. These findings provide insight
  into mechanisms underlying X-ray energy conversion through enduring electron trapping
  and offer a paradigm to motivate future research in wearable X-ray detectors for
  patient-centred radiography and mammography, imaging-guided therapeutics, high-energy
  physics and deep learning in radiology.
