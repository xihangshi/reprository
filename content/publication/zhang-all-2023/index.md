abstract: Scattering theory is the basis of all linear optical and photonic devices,
  whose spectral response underpins wide-ranging applications from sensing to energy
  conversion. Unlike the Shannon theory for communication channels, or the Fano theory
  for electric circuits, understanding the limits of spectral wave scattering remains
  a notoriously challenging open problem. We introduce a mathematical scattering representation
  that inherently embeds fundamental principles of causality and passivity into its
  elemental degrees of freedom. We use this representation to reveal strong constraints
  in the mathematical structure of scattered fields, and to develop a general theory
  of the maximum radiative heat transfer in the near field, resolving a long-standing
  open question. Our approach can be seamlessly applied to high-interest applications
  across nanophotonics, and appears extensible to general classical and quantum scattering
  theory.
