abstract: The hard X-ray nanoprobe beamline is the first beamline to take advantage
  of the full coherent beam to attain the nanoscale focusing at the Shanghai Synchrotron
  Radiation Facility (SSRF). Here we introduce the beamline and specially go over
  the features of the multilayer Kirkpatrick-Baez focusing system and its supporting
  phase compensator system. The performance and stability of the phase compensator
  are also put to the test. By using the speckle scanning metrology, the wavefront
  of a focused beam was characterized and intensity distribution near the focus was
  reconstructed. The focusing performance was greatly enhanced by two phase compensations
  based on a global optimization technique, and a two-dimensional focal spot of 26 nm × 17
  nm was achieved and maintained with good stability.
