abstract: Free electron beams such as those employed in electron microscopes have
  evolved into powerful tools to investigate photonic nanostructures with an unrivaled
  combination of spatial and spectral precision through the analysis of electron energy
  losses and cathodoluminescence light emission. In combination with ultrafast optics,
  the emerging field of ultrafast electron microscopy utilizes synchronized femtosecond
  electron and light pulses that are aimed at the sampled structures, holding the
  promise to bring simultaneous sub-Å-sub-fs-sub-meV space-time-energy resolution
  to the study of material and optical-field dynamics. In addition, these advances
  enable the manipulation of the wave function of individual free electrons in unprecedented
  ways, opening sound prospects to probe and control quantum excitations at the nanoscale.
  Here, we provide an overview of photonics research based on free electrons, supplemented
  by original theoretical insights and discussion of several stimulating challenges
  and opportunities. In particular, we show that the excitation probability by a single
  electron is independent of its wave function, apart from a classical average over
  the transverse beam density profile, whereas the probability for two or more modulated
  electrons depends on their relative spatial arrangement, thus reflecting the quantum
  nature of their interactions. We derive first-principles analytical expressions
  that embody these results and have general validity for arbitrarily shaped electrons
  and any type of electron-sample interaction. We conclude with some perspectives
  on various exciting directions that include disruptive approaches to noninvasive
  spectroscopy and microscopy, the possibility of sampling the nonlinear optical response
  at the nanoscale, the manipulation of the density matrices associated with free
  electrons and optical sample modes, and appealing applications in optical modulation
  of electron beams, all of which could potentially revolutionize the use of free
  electrons in photonics.
