abstract: The precise stacking of different two-dimensional (2D) structures such as
  graphene and MoS2 has reinvigorated the field of 2D materials, revealing exotic
  phenomena at their interfaces1,2. These unique interfaces are typically constructed
  using mechanical or deposition-based methods to build a heterostructure one monolayer
  at a time2,3. By contrast, self-assembly is a scalable technique, where complex
  materials can selectively form in solution4–6. Here we show a synthetic strategy
  for the self-assembly of layered perovskite–non-perovskite heterostructures into
  large single crystals in aqueous solution. Using bifunctional organic molecules
  as directing groups, we have isolated six layered heterostructures that form as
  an interleaving of perovskite slabs with a different inorganic lattice, previously
  unknown to crystallize with perovskites. In many cases, these intergrown lattices
  are 2D congeners of canonical inorganic structure types. To our knowledge, these
  compounds are the first layered perovskite heterostructures formed using organic
  templates and characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Notably, this interleaving
  of inorganic structures can markedly transform the band structure. Optical data
  and first principles calculations show that substantive coupling between perovskite
  and intergrowth layers leads to new electronic transitions distributed across both
  sublattices. Given the technological promise of halide perovskites4, this intuitive
  synthetic route sets a foundation for the directed synthesis of richly structured
  complex semiconductors that self-assemble in water.
