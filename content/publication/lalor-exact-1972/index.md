abstract: The exact solution of the basic equations of molecular optics is obtained
  for the problem of refraction and reflection of any given monochromatic electromagnetic
  wave (not necessarily a plane one) that is incident on a linear, homogeneous, isotropic,
  nonmagnetic dielectric filling a half-space. Our analysis provides a new derivation
  of the laws of refraction and reflection and of Fresnel formulas and throws some
  light on the role played by the Ewald–Oseen extinction theorem in solving the molecular-optics
  equations. The methods developed in this paper may be employed in determining solutions
  of the molecular-optics equations for other problems that involve the interaction
  of electromagnetic radiation and bulk matter.
