abstract: 'Scintillation materials convert high-energy radiation to optical light
  through a complex multi-stage process. The last stage of the process is light emission
  via spontaneous emission, which usually governs and limits the scintillator emission
  rate and light yield. For decades, the quest for faster emission rate and greater
  light yield motivated the frontier of scintillators research to focus on developing
  better materials and dopants. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a fundamentally
  different, recently proposed concept for enhancing the scintillation rate and yield:
  the Purcell effect. The Purcell effect is a universal enhancement mechanism for
  spontaneous emission by engineering the optical environment. In scintillators, such
  an enhancement arises from engineering the nanoscale geometry within the scintillation
  bulk, which thus applies universally to any scintillating material and dopant. We
  design and fabricate a thin multilayer nanophotonic scintillator, demonstrating
  Purcell-enhanced scintillation, achieving a 50% enhancement in emission-rate and
  an 80% enhancement in light yield. We demonstrate the potential of our device for
  realizing these enhancements in real-life settings for X-ray applications, also
  due to the robustness of the nanophotonic design to fabrication disorder. Our results
  show the bright prospects of bridging nanophotonics and scintillators science, toward
  reduced radiation dosage and increased resolution for high-energy particles detection.'
