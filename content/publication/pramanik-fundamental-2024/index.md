abstract: Water-window X-rays are crucial in medical and biological applications,
  enabling natural contrast imaging of biological cells in their near-native states
  without external staining. However, water-window X-ray sources whose output photon
  energy can be arbitrarily specified - a crucial feature in many high-contrast imaging
  applications - are still challenging to obtain except at large synchrotron facilities.
  Here, we present a solution to this challenge by demonstrating table-top, water-window
  X-ray generation from free electron-driven van der Waals materials, resulting in
  output photon energies that can be continuously tuned across the entire water window
  regime. In addition, we present a truly predictive theoretical framework that combines
  first-principles electromagnetism with Monte Carlo simulations to accurately predict
  the photon flux and brightness in absolute numbers. Using this framework, we theoretically
  obtain fundamental scaling laws for the tunable photon flux, showing good agreement
  with experimental results and providing a path to the design of powerful emitters
  based on free electron-driven quantum materials. We show that we can achieve photon
  fluxes needed for imaging and spectroscopy applications (over 1E8 photons per second
  on sample) where compactness is important, and the ultrahigh fluxes of synchrotron
  sources are not needed. Importantly, our theory highlights the critical role played
  by the large mean free paths and interlayer atomic spacings unique to van der Waals
  structures, showing the latter's advantages over other materials in generating water
  window X-rays. Our results should pave the way to advanced techniques and new modalities
  in water-window X-ray generation and high-resolution biological imaging.
