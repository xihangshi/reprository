 abstract = {The theoretical and experimental emission characteristics of the low-temperature field electron source as they relate to scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and scanning transmission electron microscopy applications are reviewed. A brief history of the development of the cold-field electron source is given. Energy distribution, angular current density, brightness, and current stability are the main source characteristics considered. A discrepancy between the analytical expression and a rigorous numerical analysis of current density is explored. The general focus of this review is on the extensively studied \textless310\textgreater- and \textless111\textgreater-oriented single-crystal tungsten sources.},
