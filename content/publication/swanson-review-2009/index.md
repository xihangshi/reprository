abstract: The theoretical and experimental emission characteristics of the low-temperature
  field electron source as they relate to scanning electron microscopy, transmission
  electron microscopy, and scanning transmission electron microscopy applications
  are reviewed. A brief history of the development of the cold-field electron source
  is given. Energy distribution, angular current density, brightness, and current
  stability are the main source characteristics considered. A discrepancy between
  the analytical expression and a rigorous numerical analysis of current density is
  explored. The general focus of this review is on the extensively studied textless310textgreater-
  and textless111textgreater-oriented single-crystal tungsten sources.
