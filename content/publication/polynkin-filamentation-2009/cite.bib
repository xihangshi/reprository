 abstract = {We report experiments on the propagation of intense, femtosecond, self-bending Airy laser beams in water. The supercontinuum radiation generated along the curved beam path is angularly resolved in the far field. Spectral maps of this radiation reveal the changing character of the laser-pulse evolution on propagation. Â© 2009 The American Physical Society.},
