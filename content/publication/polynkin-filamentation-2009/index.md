abstract: We report experiments on the propagation of intense, femtosecond, self-bending
  Airy laser beams in water. The supercontinuum radiation generated along the curved
  beam path is angularly resolved in the far field. Spectral maps of this radiation
  reveal the changing character of the laser-pulse evolution on propagation. Â© 2009
