abstract: Ultrahigh-reflectance mirrors are essential optical elements of the most
  sophisticated optical instruments devised over the entire frequency spectrum. In
  the X-ray regime, super-polished mirrors with close to 100% reflectivity are routinely
  used at grazing angles of incidence. However, at large angles of incidence, and
  particularly at normal incidence, such high reflectivity has not yet been achieved.
  Here, we demonstrate by direct measurements that synthetic, nearly defect-free diamond
  crystals reflect more than 99% of hard X-ray photons backwards in Bragg diffraction,
  with a remarkably small variation in magnitude across the sample. This is a quantum
  leap in the largest reflectivity measured to date, which is at the limit of what
  is theoretically possible. This accomplishment is achieved under the most challenging
  conditions of normal incidence and with extremely hard X-ray photons. Â© 2011 Macmillan
