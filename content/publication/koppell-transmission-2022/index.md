abstract: A number of visions for a new generation of dose-efficient electron microscopes
  have been advanced. These proposals, while inspired by quantum principles, make
  little contact with the broader field of quantum metrology. We discuss a framework
  for calculating the amount of information carried by each electron. This makes it
  possible to evaluate the potential effectiveness of any particular microscope architecture
  relative to the quantum limit for information per dose. In the case of phase imaging,
  we argue this limit is at least an order of magnitude beyond what is possible with
  aberration-free Zernike phase contrast.
