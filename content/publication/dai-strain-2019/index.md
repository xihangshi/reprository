abstract: 'Triggered by the growing needs of developing semiconductor devices at ever-decreasing
  scales, strain engineering of 2D materials has recently seen a surge of interest.
  The goal of this principle is to exploit mechanical strain to tune the electronic
  and photonic performance of 2D materials and to ultimately achieve high-performance
  2D-material-based devices. Although strain engineering has been well studied for
  traditional semiconductor materials and is now routinely used in their manufacturing,
  recent experiments on strain engineering of 2D materials have shown new opportunities
  for fundamental physics and exciting applications, along with new challenges, due
  to the atomic nature of 2D materials. Here, recent advances in the application of
  mechanical strain into 2D materials are reviewed. These developments are categorized
  by the deformation modes of the 2D material–substrate system: in-plane mode and
  out-of-plane mode. Recent state-of-the-art characterization of the interface mechanics
  for these 2D material–substrate systems is also summarized. These advances highlight
  how the strain or strain-coupled applications of 2D materials rely on the interfacial
  properties, essentially shear and adhesion, and finally offer direct guidelines
  for deterministic design of mechanical strains into 2D materials for ultrathin semiconductor
  applications.'
