abstract: The Smith–Purcell effect allows for coherent free-electron-driven compact
  light sources over the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Intriguing interaction regimes,
  with prospects for quantum optical applications, are expected when the driving free
  electron enters the sub-keV range, though this has until now remained an experimental
  challenge. Here, we demonstrate the Smith–Purcell light emission from UV to visible
  using engineerable, fabricated gratings with periodicities as low as 19 nm and with
  electron energies as low as 300 eV. Our findings constitute a major step toward
  broadband, highly tunable, on-chip light sources, observation of quantum recoil
  effects, and tunable EUV and x ray sources from swift electrons.
