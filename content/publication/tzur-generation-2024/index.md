abstract: For decades, most research of high harmonic generation (HHG) considered
  matter as quantum but light as classical. Recently, HHG driven by quantum states
  of light such as bright squeezed vacuum was predicted to reach beyond the classical
  HHG cutoff. Moreover, in squeezed coherent illumination, it was shown that the underlying
  dynamics are significantly modified by the photon statistics effective force. Here
  we show that HHG driven by quantum light results in quantum high harmonics. We derive
  a formula for the quantum state of the high harmonics, when driven by arbitrary
  quantum light states, and then explore specific cases of experimental relevance.
  Specifically, for a moderately squeezed pump, HHG driven by squeezed coherent light
  results in squeezed high harmonics. Harmonic squeezing is optimized by syncing ionization
  times with the pump's squeezing phase. Beyond this regime, as pump squeezing is
  increased, the harmonics initially acquire squeezed thermal photon statistics, and
  then occupy an intricate quantum state which strongly depends on the semiclassical
  nonlinear response function of the interacting system. Our results pave the way
  for generation of squeezed extreme-ultraviolet ultrashort pulses, and more generally,
  quantum frequency conversion into previously inaccessible spectral ranges, which
  may enable ultrasensitive attosecond metrology.     Published by the American Physical
