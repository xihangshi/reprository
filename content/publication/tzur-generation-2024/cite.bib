 abstract = {For decades, most research of high harmonic generation (HHG) considered matter as quantum but light as classical. Recently, HHG driven by quantum states of light such as bright squeezed vacuum was predicted to reach beyond the classical HHG cutoff. Moreover, in squeezed coherent illumination, it was shown that the underlying dynamics are significantly modified by the photon statistics effective force. Here we show that HHG driven by quantum light results in quantum high harmonics. We derive a formula for the quantum state of the high harmonics, when driven by arbitrary quantum light states, and then explore specific cases of experimental relevance. Specifically, for a moderately squeezed pump, HHG driven by squeezed coherent light results in squeezed high harmonics. Harmonic squeezing is optimized by syncing ionization times with the pump's squeezing phase. Beyond this regime, as pump squeezing is increased, the harmonics initially acquire squeezed thermal photon statistics, and then occupy an intricate quantum state which strongly depends on the semiclassical nonlinear response function of the interacting system. Our results pave the way for generation of squeezed extreme-ultraviolet ultrashort pulses, and more generally, quantum frequency conversion into previously inaccessible spectral ranges, which may enable ultrasensitive attosecond metrology.
