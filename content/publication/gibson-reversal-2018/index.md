abstract: The emergence of “negative” frequencies in physical systems is often accompanied
  by intriguing consequences. For example, supersonic motion between a source and
  an observer leads to a negative Doppler-shifted frequency, the physical meaning
  of which is time reversal of the received signal. To our knowledge, the rotational
  analogue of this situation—the consequences of generating negative rotationally
  Doppler-shifted waves—has not been studied. Here we show, using an acoustic source,
  that a negative rotational Doppler shift is associated with a handedness reversal
  of the orbital angular momentum carried by the wave. We demonstrate that this handedness
  reversal can occur even at significantly subsonic velocities, making our findings
  relevant to interactions of ultrafast rotating systems with optical frequency radiation.The
  linear Doppler shift is familiar as the rise and fall in pitch of a siren as it
  passes by. Less well known is the rotational Doppler shift, proportional to the
  rotation rate between source and receiver, multiplied by the angular momentum carried
  by the beam. In extreme cases the Doppler shift can be larger than the rest-frame
  frequency and for a red shift, the observed frequency then becomes “negative.” In
  the linear case, this effect is associated with the time reversal of the received
  signal, but it can be observed only with supersonic relative motion between the
  source and receiver. However, the rotational case is different; if the radius of
  rotation is smaller than the wavelength, then the velocities required to observe
  negative frequencies are subsonic. Using an acoustic source at ≈100 Hz we create
  a rotational Doppler shift larger than the laboratory-frame frequency. We observe
  that once the red-shifted wave passes into the “negative frequency” regime, the
  angular momentum associated with the sound is reversed in sign compared with that
  of the laboratory frame. These low-velocity laboratory realizations of extreme Doppler
  shifts have relevance to superoscillatory fields and offer unique opportunities
  to probe interactions with rotating bodies and aspects of pseudorelativistic frame
  translation.
