abstract: 'Slow swift electrons with low self-inertia interact differently with matter
  and light in comparison with their relativistic counterparts: they are easily recoiled,
  reflected, and also diffracted form optical gratings and nanostructures. As a consequence,
  they can be also better manipulated into the desired shape. For example, they get
  bunched quite fast in interaction with acceleration gratings in presence of an external
  electromagnetic radiation, a phenomenon which can be desirable in development of
  superradiant coherent light sources. Here, I examine the spatiotemporal behavior
  of pulsed electron wave packets at low energies interacting with pulsed light and
  optical gratings, using a quantum-mechanical self-consistent numerical toolbox which
  is introduced here. It will be shown that electron pulses are accelerated very fast
  in interaction with the near-field of the grating, demanding that a synchronicity
  condition is met. To prevent the electrons to be transversely deflected from the
  grating a symmetric double-grating configuration is necessary. It is found that
  even in this configuration, diffraction due to the interaction of the electron with
  the standing-wave light inside the gap between the gratings, is a source of defocusing.
  Moreover, the longitudinal broadening of the electron pulse directly affects the
  final shape of the electron wave packet due to the occurrence of multiple electron-photon
  scatterings. These investigations pave the way towards the design of more efficient
  electron-driven photon sources and accelerators.'
