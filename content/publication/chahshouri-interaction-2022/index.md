abstract: Abstract  Cherenkov radiation (CR) from electrons propagating in materials
  with a high refractive index have applications in particle-detection mechanisms
  and could be used for high-yield coherent electron beam-driven photon sources. However,
  the theory of the CR has been treated up to now using the non-recoil approximation,
  which neglects the effect of electron deceleration in materials. Here, we report
  on the effect of electron-beam deceleration on the radiated spectrum and exciton-photon
  interactions in nm-thick WSe 2 crystals. The calculation of the CR is performed
  by simulating the kinetic energy of an electron propagating in a thick sample using
  the Monto Carlo method combined with the Lienardâ€“Wiechert retarded potential. Using
  this approach, we numerically investigate the interaction between the excitons and
  generated photons (CR) beyond the non-recoil approximation and are able to reproduce
  experimental cathodoluminescence spectra. Our findings pave the way for an accurate
  design of particle scintillators and detectors, based on the strong-coupling phenomenon.
