Cherenkov radiation (CR) from electrons propagating in materials with a high refractive index have applications in particle-detection mechanisms and could be used for high-yield coherent electron beam-driven photon sources. However, the theory of the CR has been treated up to now using the non-recoil approximation, which neglects the effect of electron deceleration in materials. Here, we report on the effect of electron-beam deceleration on the radiated spectrum and exciton-photon interactions in nm-thick WSe

crystals. The calculation of the CR is performed by simulating the kinetic energy of an electron propagating in a thick sample using the Monto Carlo method combined with the Lienardâ€“Wiechert retarded potential. Using this approach, we numerically investigate the interaction between the excitons and generated photons (CR) beyond the non-recoil approximation and are able to reproduce experimental cathodoluminescence spectra. Our findings pave the way for an accurate design of particle scintillators and detectors, based on the strong-coupling phenomenon.},
