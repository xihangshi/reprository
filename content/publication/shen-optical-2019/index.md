abstract: Thirty years ago, Coullet et al. proposed that a special optical field exists
  in laser cavities bearing some analogy with the superfluid vortex. Since then, optical
  vortices have been widely studied, inspired by the hydrodynamics sharing similar
  mathematics. Akin to a fluid vortex with a central flow singularity, an optical
  vortex beam has a phase singularity with a certain topological charge, giving rise
  to a hollow intensity distribution. Such a beam with helical phase fronts and orbital
  angular momentum reveals a subtle connection between macroscopic physical optics
  and microscopic quantum optics. These amazing properties provide a new understanding
  of a wide range of optical and physical phenomena, including twisting photons, spin–orbital
  interactions, Bose–Einstein condensates, etc., while the associated technologies
  for manipulating optical vortices have become increasingly tunable and flexible.
  Hitherto, owing to these salient properties and optical manipulation technologies,
  tunable vortex beams have engendered tremendous advanced applications such as optical
  tweezers, high-order quantum entanglement, and nonlinear optics. This article reviews
  the recent progress in tunable vortex technologies along with their advanced applications.
