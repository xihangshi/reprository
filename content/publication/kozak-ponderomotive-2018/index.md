abstract: Atomic motion dynamics during structural changes or chemical reactions have
  been visualized by pico- and femtosecond pulsed electron beams via ultrafast electron
  diffraction and microscopy. Imaging the even faster dynamics of electrons in atoms,
  molecules, and solids requires electron pulses with subfemtosecond durations. We
  demonstrate here the all-optical generation of trains of attosecond free-electron
  pulses. The concept is based on the periodic energy modulation of a pulsed electron
  beam via an inelastic interaction, with the ponderomotive potential of an optical
  traveling wave generated by two femtosecond laser pulses at different frequencies
  in vacuum. The subsequent dispersive propagation leads to a compression of the electrons
  and the formation of ultrashort pulses. The longitudinal phase space evolution of
  the electrons after compression is mapped by a second phase-locked interaction.
  The comparison of measured and calculated spectrograms reveals the attosecond temporal
  structure of the compressed electron pulse trains with individual pulse durations
  of less than 300 as. This technique can be utilized for tailoring and initial characterization
  of suboptical-cycle free-electron pulses at high repetition rates for stroboscopic
  time-resolved experiments with subfemtosecond time resolution.
