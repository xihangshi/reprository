abstract: In past decades, terahertz radiation, which locates between microwave and
  far-infrared light in the electromagnetic spectrum, has attracted more and more
  attention. Various passive and active components such as absorbers, filters, polarizers,
  and focusing lenses have been developed for manipulating terahertz radiation. With
  the further evolution of metamaterials and metasurfaces, unprecedented freedom is
  gained for flexibly controlling terahertz waves, including focusing, deflection,
  beam steering, polarization conversion, and generation of orbit angular momentum.
  Among them, terahertz beam steering has become the focus of considerable interest
  owing to its significance for wireless communication, high-resolution imaging, and
  radar applications. In this paper, first the conventional terahertz beam steering
  technologies are reviewed, including mechanical scanning, phased array, frequency
  scanning antennas, and multibeam switching technology. Then, the reconfigurable
  metasurface routes based on semiconductor active components, phase transition materials,
  electrically tunable materials, and micro-electromechanical technology are summarized
  and the respective performances for terahertz beam steering are discussed. Moreover,
  programmable metasurfaces with digitalized description of metasurfaces and real-time
  manipulations of radiation patterns are also illustrated in detail. Finally, a summary
  of the present terahertz beam steering technologies is provided and an outlook for
  the future is discussed.
