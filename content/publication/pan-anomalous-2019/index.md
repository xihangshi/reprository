abstract: 'We reveal the classical and quantum regimes of free electron interaction
  with radiation, common to the general variety of radiation sources (e.g., a Smith-Purcell
  radiation), the dielectric laser accelerator, and photo-induced near-field electron
  microscopy (PINEM). Modeling the electron with initial conditions of a coherent
  quantum electron wave packet, its topology in phase space uniquely defines a universal
  distinction of three interaction regimes: point-particle-like acceleration, a quantum
  wave function (PINEM), and a newly reported regime of anomalous PINEM (APINEM).
  The quantum interference beat of APINEM is capable of improving the spectral resolution
  of postselective electron microscopy. The particle-wave duality transition between
  regimes reveals the history-dependent nature of quantum electron interaction with
  light.'
