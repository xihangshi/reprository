abstract: The maximum achievable photon energy of compact, conventional, Compton-scattering
  X-ray sources is currently limited by the maximum permissible field gradient of
  conventional electron accelerators1,2. An alternative compact Compton X-ray source
  architecture with no such limitation is based instead on a high-field-gradient laser–wakefield
  accelerator3,4,5,6. In this case, a single high-power (100 TW) laser system generates
  intense laser pulses, which are used for both electron acceleration and scattering.
  Although such all-laser-based sources have been demonstrated to be bright and energetic
  in proof-of-principle experiments7,8,9,10, to date they have lacked several important
  distinguishing characteristics of conventional Compton sources. We now report the
  experimental demonstration of all-laser-driven Compton X-rays that are both quasi-monoenergetic
  (∼50% full-width at half-maximum) and tunable (∼70 keV to textgreater1 MeV). These
  performance improvements are highly beneficial for several important X-ray radiological
  applications2,11,12,13,14,15.
