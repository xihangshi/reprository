abstract: Abstract Recent advances in the physics and technology of light generation
  via free-electron proximity and impact interactions with nanostructures (gratings,
  photonic crystals, nano-undulators, metamaterials and antenna arrays) have enabled
  the development of nanoscale-resolution techniques for such applications as mapping
  plasmons, studying nanoparticle structural transformations and characterizing luminescent
  materials (including time-resolved measurements). Here, we introduce a universal
  approach allowing generation of light with prescribed wavelength, direction, divergence
  and topological charge via point-excitation of holographic plasmonic metasurfaces.
  It is illustrated using medium-energy free-electron injection to generate highly-directional
  visible to near-infrared light beams, at selected wavelengths in prescribed azimuthal
  and polar directions, with brightness two orders of magnitude higher than that from
  an unstructured surface, and vortex beams with topological charge up to ten. Such
  emitters, with micron-scale dimensions and the freedom to fully control radiation
  parameters, offer novel applications in nano-spectroscopy, nano-chemistry and sensing.
