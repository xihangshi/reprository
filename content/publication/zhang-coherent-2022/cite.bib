 abstract = {Surface plasmonics with its unique confinement of light1,2 is expected to be a cornerstone for future compact radiation sources and integrated photonics devices. The energy transfer between light and matter is a defining aspect that underlies recent studies on optical surface-wave-mediated spontaneous emissions3–5. However, coherent stimulated emission of free electrons, which is essential for free-electron light sources, and its dynamical amplification process remain to be disclosed in a clear, unambiguous and calibrated manner. Here we present the coherent amplification of terahertz surface plasmon polaritons via free-electron-stimulated emission: a femtosecond optical pulse creates an in-phase free-electron pulse with an initial terahertz surface wave, and their ensuing interactions intensify the terahertz surface wave coherently. The underlying dynamics of the amplification, including a twofold redshift in the radiation frequency over a one-millimetre interaction length, are resolved as electromagnetic-field-profile evolutions using an optical pump–probe method. By extending the approach to a properly phase-matched electron bunch, our theoretical analysis predicts a super-radiant surface-wave growth, which lays the ground for a stimulated surface-wave light source and may facilitate capable means for matter manipulation, especially in the terahertz band.},
