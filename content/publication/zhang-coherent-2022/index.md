abstract: 'Surface plasmonics with its unique confinement of light1,2 is expected
  to be a cornerstone for future compact radiation sources and integrated photonics
  devices. The energy transfer between light and matter is a defining aspect that
  underlies recent studies on optical surface-wave-mediated spontaneous emissions3–5.
  However, coherent stimulated emission of free electrons, which is essential for
  free-electron light sources, and its dynamical amplification process remain to be
  disclosed in a clear, unambiguous and calibrated manner. Here we present the coherent
  amplification of terahertz surface plasmon polaritons via free-electron-stimulated
  emission: a femtosecond optical pulse creates an in-phase free-electron pulse with
  an initial terahertz surface wave, and their ensuing interactions intensify the
  terahertz surface wave coherently. The underlying dynamics of the amplification,
  including a twofold redshift in the radiation frequency over a one-millimetre interaction
  length, are resolved as electromagnetic-field-profile evolutions using an optical
  pump–probe method. By extending the approach to a properly phase-matched electron
  bunch, our theoretical analysis predicts a super-radiant surface-wave growth, which
  lays the ground for a stimulated surface-wave light source and may facilitate capable
  means for matter manipulation, especially in the terahertz band.'
