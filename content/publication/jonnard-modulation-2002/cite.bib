 abstract = {We report on the intensity modulation of a characteristic x-ray line emitted by a periodic structure, as a function of the observation angle. This intensity variation takes place around the Bragg direction corresponding to the diffraction of the x-ray line by the emitting structure. An enhancement of the emitted radiation is observed and interpreted on the basis of the reciprocity theorem. The enhancement remains unchanged by varying the number of emitting periods. Following Yariv and Yeh [J. Opt. Soc. Am. 67, 438 (1977)], a possible application as x-ray resonator to achieve a distributed feedback soft x-ray laser is envisaged.},
