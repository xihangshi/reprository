abstract: We report on the intensity modulation of a characteristic x-ray line emitted
  by a periodic structure, as a function of the observation angle. This intensity
  variation takes place around the Bragg direction corresponding to the diffraction
  of the x-ray line by the emitting structure. An enhancement of the emitted radiation
  is observed and interpreted on the basis of the reciprocity theorem. The enhancement
  remains unchanged by varying the number of emitting periods. Following Yariv and
  Yeh [J. Opt. Soc. Am. 67, 438 (1977)], a possible application as x-ray resonator
  to achieve a distributed feedback soft x-ray laser is envisaged.
