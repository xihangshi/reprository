abstract: Over the last dozen of years, the area of accelerating waves has made considerable
  advances not only in terms of fundamentals and experimental demonstrations but also
  in connection to a wide range of applications. Starting from the prototypical Airy
  beam that was proposed and observed in 2007, new families of accelerating waves
  have been identified in the paraxial and nonparaxial domains in space and/or time,
  with different methods developed to control at will their trajectory, amplitude,
  and beam width. Accelerating optical waves exhibit a number of highly desirable
  attributes. They move along a curved or accelerating trajectory while being resilient
  to perturbations (self-healing), and, are diffraction-free. It is because of these
  particular features that accelerating waves have been utilized in a variety of applications
  in the areas of filamentation, beam focusing, particle manipulation, biomedical
  imaging, plasmons, and material processing among others.
