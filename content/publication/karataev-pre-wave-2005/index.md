abstract: Transition radiation (TR) and diffraction radiation (DR) appearing as a
  result of dynamic polarization of medium has widely been used for electron beam
  diagnostics during the last few years. A lot of techniques for electron beam diagnostics
  imply description of these phenomena assuming that the radiated area of the target
  is negligibly small in comparison with the radiation spot in the detector plane
  (far-field approximation). However, for high-energy electrons this area may reach
  a macroscopic dimension. In this Letter the general theory in the pre-wave zone
  is presented. Two new approaches for rejecting the pre-wave zone effect are described
  and analyzed. By installing a thin lens in the optical path of the measurement system
  or by developing a concave target, the pre-wave zone effect can be reduced or even
  rejected. Â© 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
