abstract: The coherence of free-electron laser (FEL) radiation has so far been accessed
  mainly through first and second order correlation functions. Instead, we propose
  to reconstruct the energy state occupation number distribution of FEL radiation,
  avoiding the photo-counting drawbacks with high intensities, by means of maximum
  likelihood techniques based on the statistics of no-click events. Though the ultimate
  goal regards the FEL radiation statistical features, the interest of the proposal
  also resides in its applicability to any process of harmonic generation from a coherent
  light pulse, ushering in the study of the preservation of quantum features in general
  non-linear optical processes.
