 abstract = {This book provides a comprehensive description of the physics of Rydberg atoms, highlighting their remarkable properties by reference to their behavior in a wide range of physical situations. Following an overview of the basic properties of Rydberg atoms, their interactions with electric and magnetic fields are analyzed in detail. The collisions of Rydberg atoms with neutral and charged species are described, and the use of multichannel quantum defect theory in the study of Rydberg atomic systems is discussed.},
