abstract: This book provides a comprehensive description of the physics of Rydberg
  atoms, highlighting their remarkable properties by reference to their behavior in
  a wide range of physical situations. Following an overview of the basic properties
  of Rydberg atoms, their interactions with electric and magnetic fields are analyzed
  in detail. The collisions of Rydberg atoms with neutral and charged species are
  described, and the use of multichannel quantum defect theory in the study of Rydberg
  atomic systems is discussed.
