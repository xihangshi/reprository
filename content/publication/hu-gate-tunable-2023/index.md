abstract: Negative refraction provides a platform to manipulate mid-infrared and terahertz
  radiation for molecular sensing and thermal emission applications. However, its
  implementation based on metamaterials and plasmonic media presents challenges with
  optical losses, limited spatial confinement, and lack of active tunability in this
  spectral range. We demonstrate gate-tunable negative refraction at mid-infrared
  frequencies using hybrid topological polaritons in van der Waals heterostructures.
  Specifically, we visualize wide-angle negatively refracted polaritons in α-MoO3
  films partially decorated with graphene, undergoing reversible planar nanoscale
  focusing. Our atomically thick heterostructures weaken scattering losses at the
  interface while enabling an actively tunable transition of normal to negative refraction
  through electrical gating. We propose polaritonic negative refraction as a promising
  platform for infrared applications such as electrically tunable super-resolution
  imaging, nanoscale thermal manipulation, enhanced molecular sensing, and on-chip
  optical circuitry. Refraction is a familiar effect in which a light beam alters
  direction as it propagates from one medium to another. Negative refraction is a
  nonintuitive but well-established effect in which the light beam is bent in the
  ?wrong? direction. Two groups now independently demonstrate negative refraction
  at the interface of two-dimensional van der Waal materials. Hu et al. used molybdenum
  trioxide with a graphene overlayer to show that in-plane negative refraction of
  mid-infrared (mid-IR) polaritons occurs at the interface and is gate tunable. Sternbach
  et al. used molybdenum trioxide/hexagonal boron nitride bicrystals to show that
  negative refraction of mid-IR polaritons occurs for propagation normal to the interface.
  Polaritonic negative refraction in the mid-IR provides opportunities for optical
  and thermal applications such as IR super-resolution imaging, nanoscale thermal
  manipulation, and chemical sensing devices with enhanced sensitivity. ?ISO Gate
  tunable nanoscale negative refraction of polaritons is demonstrated at the interface
  of 2D materials.
