abstract: Understanding how the mechanical behaviour of materials deviates at the
  nanoscale from the macroscopically established concepts is a key challenge of particular
  importance for graphene, given the complex interplay between its nanoscale morphology
  and electronic properties 1-5 . In this work, the (sub)nanometre-wavelength periodic
  rippling of suspended graphene nanomembranes has been realized by thermal strain
  engineering and investigated using scanning tunnelling microscopy. This allows us
  to explore the rippling of a crystalline membrane with wavelengths comparable to
  its lattice constant. The observed nanorippling mode violates the predictions of
  the continuum model 6 , and evidences the breakdown of the plate idealization of
  the graphene monolayer. Nevertheless, microscopic simulations based on a quantum
  mechanical description of the chemical binding accurately describe the observed
  rippling mode and elucidate the origin of the continuum model breakdown. Spatially
  resolved tunnelling spectroscopy measurements indicate a substantial influence of
  the nanoripples on the local electronic structure of graphene and reveal the formation
  of one-dimensional electronic superlattices. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.
