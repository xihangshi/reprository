 abstract = {Understanding how the mechanical behaviour of materials deviates at the nanoscale from the macroscopically established concepts is a key challenge of particular importance for graphene, given the complex interplay between its nanoscale morphology and electronic properties 1-5 . In this work, the (sub)nanometre-wavelength periodic rippling of suspended graphene nanomembranes has been realized by thermal strain engineering and investigated using scanning tunnelling microscopy. This allows us to explore the rippling of a crystalline membrane with wavelengths comparable to its lattice constant. The observed nanorippling mode violates the predictions of the continuum model 6 , and evidences the breakdown of the plate idealization of the graphene monolayer. Nevertheless, microscopic simulations based on a quantum mechanical description of the chemical binding accurately describe the observed rippling mode and elucidate the origin of the continuum model breakdown. Spatially resolved tunnelling spectroscopy measurements indicate a substantial influence of the nanoripples on the local electronic structure of graphene and reveal the formation of one-dimensional electronic superlattices. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},
