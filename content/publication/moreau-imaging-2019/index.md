abstract: The production of pairs of entangled photons simply by focusing a laser
  beam onto a crystal with a nonlinear optical response was used to test quantum mechanics
  and to open new approaches in imaging. The development of the latter was enabled
  by the emergence of single-photon-sensitive cameras that are able to characterize
  spatial correlations and high-dimensional entanglement. Thereby, new techniques
  emerged, such as ghost imaging of objects — in which the quantum correlations between
  photons reveal the image from photons that have never interacted with the object
  — or imaging with undetected photons by using nonlinear interferometers. In addition,
  quantum approaches in imaging can also lead to an improvement in the performance
  of conventional imaging systems. These improvements can be obtained by means of
  image contrast, resolution enhancement that exceeds the classical limit and acquisition
  of sub-shot-noise phase or amplitude images. In this Review, we discuss the application
  of quantum states of light for advanced imaging techniques.
