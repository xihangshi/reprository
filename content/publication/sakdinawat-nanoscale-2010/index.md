abstract: Recent years have seen significant progress in the field of soft- and hard-X-ray
  microscopy, both technically, through developments in source, optics and imaging
  methodologies, and also scientifically, through a wide range of applications. While
  an ever-growing community is pursuing the extensive applications of today's available
  X-ray tools, other groups are investigating improvements in techniques, including
  new optics, higher spatial resolutions, brighter compact sources and shorter-duration
  X-ray pulses. This Review covers recent work in the development of direct image-forming
  X-ray microscopy techniques and the relevant applications, including three-dimensional
  biological tomography, dynamical processes in magnetic nanostructures, chemical
  speciation studies, industrial applications related to solar cells and batteries,
  and studies of archaeological materials and historical works of art.
