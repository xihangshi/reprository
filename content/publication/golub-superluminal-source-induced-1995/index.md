abstract: Raman emission by an axicon-generated superluminal source is demonstrated.
  The anti-Stokes radiation is emitted at an angle defined by a Čerenkov-type condition.
  This technique of superluminal-source generation has advantages in both low pump
  self-phase modulation and compensation of temporal walk-off caused by group-velocity
  dispersion, rendering the scheme useful for efficient Raman conversion, pump–probe
  measurements, and harmonic and optical parametric generation with ultrashort intense
  pulses.
