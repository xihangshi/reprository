 abstract = {Raman emission by an axicon-generated superluminal source is demonstrated. The anti-Stokes radiation is emitted at an angle defined by a Čerenkov-type condition. This technique of superluminal-source generation has advantages in both low pump self-phase modulation and compensation of temporal walk-off caused by group-velocity dispersion, rendering the scheme useful for efficient Raman conversion, pump–probe measurements, and harmonic and optical parametric generation with ultrashort intense pulses.},
