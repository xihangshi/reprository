abstract: A novel 1‐D X‐ray waveguide, the Mo/C waveguide array (WGA), is introduced
  to tailor the optical near field distribution by precisely designed and controlled
  multi‐beam interference at 19.9 keV hard X‐ray energy. Seven precisely controlled
  guiding layers with optimized layer thickness variation were fabricated by high‐precision
  direct‐current magnetron sputtering of amorphous carbon (C) and molybdenum (Mo).
  The thickness variations are designed in such a way to introduce the desired phase
  shifts between the guided output beams, to act as a quasi‐focusing device. The WGA
  and the layer thicknesses are characterized by X‐ray reflectivity, transmission
  electron microscopy, and measurement of the synchrotron radiation far‐field intensity
  pattern. Based on the measurements and simulations, a reliable Mo/C multilayer layers
  combination can be verified. With the layers thicknesses, simulations inside the
  WGA and in the optical near field behind it show that multi‐beam interference with
  the designed phase shifts lead to a relative beam intensity of 0.59 in a quasi‐focal
  plane 0.08 mm behind the exit, with a spot size of 23.8 nm. Copyright © 2017 John
