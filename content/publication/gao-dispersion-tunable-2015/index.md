abstract: Â© 2015 Optical Society of America. We propose and experimentally demonstrate
  an approach to efficiently tune the dispersion of a designer-plasmonic resonator,
  or a plasmonic 'meta-atom', by incorporating an extra ground plane underneath. We
  demonstrate that this ground plane is able to enhance resonances, and the enhancing
  effect can render those higher-order azimuthal modes, being absent in previously
  reported designer-plasmonic resonators, experimentally observable. After incorporating
  the ground plane, all resonance modes are red shifted with their Q factors enhanced.
  By increasing the separation from the planar resonator to the underneath ground
  plane, all enhanced modes are blue shifted with Q factors decreased slightly, whose
  trend is opposite to increasing the thickness of a dielectric substrate of a common
  meta-atom without a ground. These results may find potential applications in tunable
  designer-plasmonic sensors and plasmonic metamaterial designs.
