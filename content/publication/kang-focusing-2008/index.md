abstract: We report improved results for hard x-ray focusing using a multilayer Laue
  lens (MLL). We have measured a line focus of 16 nm width with an efficiency of 31%
  at a wavelength λ=0.064 nm (19.5 keV) using a partial MLL structure with an outermost
  zone width of 5 nm. The results are in good agreement with the theoretically predicted
  performance. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.
