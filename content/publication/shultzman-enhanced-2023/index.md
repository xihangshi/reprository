abstract: 'Abstract  Converting ionizing radiation into visible light is essential
  in a wide range of fundamental and industrial applications, such as electromagnetic
  calorimeters in high‐energy particle detectors, electron detectors, image intensifiers,
  and X‐ray imaging. These different areas of technology all rely on scintillators
  or phosphors, i.e., materials that emit light upon bombardment by high‐energy particles.
  In all cases, the emission is through spontaneous emission . The fundamental nature
  of spontaneous emission poses limitations on all these technologies, imposing an
  intrinsic trade‐off between efficiency and resolution in all imaging applications:
  thicker phosphors are more efficient due to their greater stopping power, which
  however comes at the expense of image blurring due to light spread inside the thicker
  phosphors. Here, the concept of inverse‐designed nanophotonic scintillators is proposed,
  which can overcome the trade‐off between resolution and efficiency by reshaping
  the intrinsic spontaneous emission. To exemplify the concept, multilayer phosphor
  nanostructures are designed and these nanostructures are compared to state‐of‐the‐art
  phosphor screens in image intensifiers, showing a threefold resolution enhancement
  simultaneous with a threefold efficiency enhancement. The enabling concept is applying
  the ubiquitous Purcell effect for the first time in a new context—for improving
  image resolution. Looking forward, this approach directly applies to a wide range
  of technologies, including X‐ray imaging applications.'
