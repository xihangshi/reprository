 abstract = {This review concerns radiation phenomena accompanying the passage of charged relativistic particles and high-energy photons through periodic media. Radiation processes involving the uniform motion or Coulomb scattering of relativistic particles are discussed. The results obtained in this field are widely used in current physical research in such areas as high-energy physics, solid state physics, technology development, and apparatus design.},
