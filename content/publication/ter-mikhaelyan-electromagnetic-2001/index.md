abstract: This review concerns radiation phenomena accompanying the passage of charged
  relativistic particles and high-energy photons through periodic media. Radiation
  processes involving the uniform motion or Coulomb scattering of relativistic particles
  are discussed. The results obtained in this field are widely used in current physical
  research in such areas as high-energy physics, solid state physics, technology development,
  and apparatus design.
