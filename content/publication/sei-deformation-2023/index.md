abstract: This study reported the longitudinal compression and extension of an electron
  bunch by free electron laser (FEL) interaction. By observing coherent edge radiation
  generated by an FEL facility at Kyoto University, which has the highest extraction
  efficiency of an FEL oscillation, we found that an electron bunch interacting with
  a cavity-type linac FEL elongated when a detuning length of an optical cavity was
  positive. The transition from compression to extension of the electron bunch was
  bounded by a perfect synchronism condition between the electron bunch and the FEL
  pulse, and the change rate of the root-mean-square bunch length was as high as 14%.
  Therefore, it was experimentally demonstrated that a slight temporal difference
  between the electron bunch and the optical pulse dramatically changed not only the
  FEL power but also the outline of electron distribution in the bunch.
