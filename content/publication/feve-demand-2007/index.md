abstract: We report on the electron analog of the single-photon gun. On-demand single-electron
  injection in a quantum conductor was obtained using a quantum dot connected to the
  conductor via a tunnel barrier. Electron emission was triggered by the application
  of a potential step that compensated for the dot-charging energy. Depending on the
  barrier transparency, the quantum emission time ranged from 0.1 to 10 nanoseconds.
  The single-electron source should prove useful for the use of quantum bits in ballistic
  conductors. Additionally, periodic sequences of single-electron emission and absorption
  generate a quantized alternating current.
