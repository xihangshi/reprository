abstract: Summary We demonstrate simultaneous phase and amplitude extraction from
  a single defocused image of a homogeneous object. Subject to the assumptions explicitly
  stated in the derivation, the algorithm solves the twin‐image problem of in‐line
  holography and is capable of analysing data obtained using X‐ray microscopy, electron
  microscopy, neutron microscopy or visible‐light microscopy, especially as they relate
  to defocus and point projection methods. Our simple, robust, non‐iterative and computationally
  efficient method is applied to data obtained using an X‐ray phase contrast ultramicroscope.
