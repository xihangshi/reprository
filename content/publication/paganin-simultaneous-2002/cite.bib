 abstract = {Summary We demonstrate simultaneous phase and amplitude extraction from a single defocused image of a homogeneous object. Subject to the assumptions explicitly stated in the derivation, the algorithm solves the twin‐image problem of in‐line holography and is capable of analysing data obtained using X‐ray microscopy, electron microscopy, neutron microscopy or visible‐light microscopy, especially as they relate to defocus and point projection methods. Our simple, robust, non‐iterative and computationally efficient method is applied to data obtained using an X‐ray phase contrast ultramicroscope.},
