abstract: Light–electron interaction is the seminal ingredient in free-electron lasers
  and dynamical investigation of matter. Pushing the coherent control of electrons
  by light to the attosecond timescale and below would enable unprecedented applications
  in quantum circuits and exploration of electronic motions and nuclear phenomena.
  Here we demonstrate attosecond coherent manipulation of a free-electron wave function,
  and show that it can be pushed down to the zeptosecond regime. We make a relativistic
  single-electron wavepacket interact in free-space with a semi-infinite light field
  generated by two light pulses reflected from a mirror and delayed by fractions of
  the optical cycle. The amplitude and phase of the resulting electron–state coherent
  oscillations are mapped in energy-momentum space via momentum-resolved ultrafast
  electron spectroscopy. The experimental results are in full agreement with our analytical
  theory, which predicts access to the zeptosecond timescale by adopting semi-infinite
  X-ray pulses.
