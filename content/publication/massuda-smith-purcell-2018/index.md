abstract: Recent advances in the fabrication of nanostructures and nanoscale features
  in metasurfaces offer a new prospect for generating visible, light emission from
  low energy electrons. In this paper, we present the experimental observation of
  visible light emission from low-energy free electrons interacting with nanoscale
  periodic surfaces through the Smith-Purcell (SP) effect. SP radiation is emitted
  when electrons pass in close proximity over a periodic structure, inducing collective
  charge motion or dipole excitations near the surface, thereby giving rise to electromagnetic
  radiation. We demonstrate a controlled emission of SP light from nanoscale gold
  gratings with periodicity as small as 50 nm, enabling the observation of visible
  SP radiation by low energy electrons (1.5 to 6 keV), an order of magnitude lower
  than previously reported. We study the emission wavelength and intensity dependence
  on the grating pitch and electron energy, showing agreement between experiment and
  theory. Further reduction of structure periodicity should enable the production
  of SP-based devices that operate with even slower electrons that allow an even smaller
  footprint and facilitate the investigation of quantum effects for light generation
  in nanoscale devices. A tunable light source integrated in an electron microscope
  would enable the development of novel electron-optical correlated spectroscopic
  techniques, with additional applications ranging from biological imaging to solid-state
  lighting.
