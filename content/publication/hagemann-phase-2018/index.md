abstract: X-ray phase contrast imaging based on free space propagation relies on phase
  retrieval to obtain sharp images of micro- and nanoscale objects, with widespread
  applications in material science and biomedical research. For high resolution synchrotron
  experiments, phase retrieval is largely based on the single step reconstruction
  using the contrast transfer function approach (CTF), as introduced almost twenty
  years ago [Cloetens et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 75, 2912 (1999)]. Notwithstanding
  its tremendous merits, this scheme makes stringent assumptions on the optical properties
  of the object, requiring, in particular, a weakly varying phase. In this work, we
  show how significant the loss in image quality becomes if these assumption are violated,
  and how phase retrieval can be easily improved by a simple scheme of alternating
  projections. Importantly, the approach demonstrated here uses the same input data
  and constraint sets as the conventional CTF-based phase retrieval, and is particularly
  well suited for the holographic regime.
