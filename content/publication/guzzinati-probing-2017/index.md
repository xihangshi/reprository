abstract: Plasmonics, the science and technology of the interaction of light with
  metallic objects, is fundamentally changing the way we can detect, generate and
  manipulate light. Although the field is progressing swiftly, thanks to the availability
  of nanoscale manufacturing and analysis methods, fundamental properties such as
  the plasmonic excitations’ symmetries cannot be accessed directly, leading to a
  partial, sometimes incorrect, understanding of their properties. Here we overcome
  this limitation by deliberately shaping the wave function of an electron beam to
  match a plasmonic excitations’ symmetry in a modified transmission electron microscope.
  We show experimentally and theoretically that this offers selective detection of
  specific plasmon modes within metallic nanoparticles, while excluding modes with
  other symmetries. This method resembles the widespread use of polarized light for
  the selective excitation of plasmon modes with the advantage of locally probing
  the response of individual plasmonic objects and a far wider range of symmetry selection
  criteria.
