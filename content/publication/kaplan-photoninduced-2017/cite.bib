 abstract = {Photon-induced near-field electron microscopy (PINEM) is atechnique to produce and then image evanescent electromagnetic fields on the surfaces of nanostructures.M ost previous applications of PINEM have imaged surface plas-mon-polariton waves on conducting nanomaterials.H ere,t he application of PINEM on whole human cancer cells and membrane vesicles isolated from them is reported. We show that photons induce time-, orientation-, and polarization-dependent evanescent fields on the surfaces of A431 cancer cells and isolated membrane vesicles.F urthermore,t he addition of aligand to the major surface receptor on these cells and vesicles (epidermal growth factor receptor,EGFR) reduces the intensity of these fields in both preparations.Wepropose that in the absence of plasmon waves in biological samples,t hese evanescent fields reflect the changes in EGFR kinase domain polarization upon ligand binding. Aselectrons can be accelerated until their wavelengths are much smaller than one ngstrçm, electron microscopes have been able to deliver spatial information about awide variety of materials at atomic resolution. Thed evelopment of ultrafast electron microscopy (UEM) has now added atomic-scale time resolution (femtosecond) as well, providing new insight into dynamics. [1, 2] UEM achieves this by combining at ransmission electron microscope (TEM) with two femtosecond laser pulses. [3] Thef irst pulse (the "pump" or clocking pulse) is directed to the sample,w here it induces dynamic changes.T he second, "probe" pulse irradiates the TEM cathode to generate an electron (the "electron" pulse), which is then accelerated and focused onto the sample ac ontrollable number of femtoseconds after (or before) the pump pulse.I mages are built up by many millions of pump-probe events,w hich each involve as ingle electron. Over the last decade,U EM has been used to study the structure and dynamics of materials using imaging,diffraction, and electron energy loss spectroscopy as detection modes. [4-10] In the variation of UEM called photon-induced near-field electron microscopy (PINEM), the precise spatiotemporal overlap between the pump pulse and the electron pulse on the surface of an anostructure leads to an electron-photon coupling between the imaging electron and the evanescent fields induced by the pump pulse on the nanostructure surface. [11, 12] Owing to the coupling,t he electron can gain or lose energy in multiples of the photon quanta. By allowing only the electrons that gain energy to pass through the energy filter, it is possible to visualize the dynamic evanescent electromagnetic fields created on the sample surface by the pump pulse.Although still in its infancy,PINEM has already been used for instance to study the quantum behavior of Rabi oscillations, [13] the wave-particle duality of light, [14] ultrashort electron packets, [15, 16] nanoparticle entanglement, [17] dielectric properties, [18, 19] and the ultrafast dynamics of conducting nanomaterials. [20] Despite its wide applications in inorganic nanomaterials,t he biological applications of PINEM have thus far been limited to as ingle study on purified protein vesicles and Escherichia coli. [21] Photon-induced near fields were demonstrated on the aforementioned biological materials ,b ut hitherto no physical explanations have been offered for the effect in these materials,w hich lack conducting electrons. Herein, we explore the use of PINEM on human cancer cells,namely A431 cells,and membrane vesicles isolated from them and the effect of ligand binding on the electron-photon coupling on the edges of these cells and membrane vesicles. A431 human cancer cells are known to have high expression levels of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on their surface (ca. 2.5  10 6 receptors/cell). [22] EGFR is at yro-sine kinase receptor involved in cell proliferation and division and is directly implicated in the development of many cancers. [23] The1 286 amino acid receptor consists of an extracellular domain (ECD), at ransmembrane domain, aj uxtamembrane domain, ak inase domain, and an unstruc-tured C-terminal tail. Upon binding to its ligand, the epidermal growth factor (EGF), the receptor becomes phosphorylated and forms dimers on the cell surface. [24] Atomic models for isolated domains of EGFR are available from X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. [25-28] Recently,aNMR study provided insight into the dynamics and ligand-induced activation mechanism of the full-length EGFR in native membrane vesicles. [29] Our results here demonstrate that femtosecond laser pulses induce the for-[*] Dr.},
