abstract: The efficient conversion of optical laser light into bright ultrafast x-ray
  pulses in laser created plasmas is of high interest for dense plasma physics studies,
  material science, and other fields. However, the rapid hydrodynamic expansion that
  cools hot plasmas has limited the x-ray conversion efficiency (CE) to 1% or less.
  Here we demonstrate more than one order of magnitude increase in picosecond x-ray
  CE by tailoring near solid density plasmas to achieve a large radiative to hydrodynamic
  energy loss rate ratio, leading into a radiation loss dominated plasma regime. A
  record 20% CE into h&#x03BD;&gt;1&#x2009;&#x2009;keV photons was measured in arrays
  of large aspect ratio Au nanowires heated to keV temperatures with ultrahigh contrast
  femtosecond laser pulses of relativistic intensity. The potential of these bright
  ultrafast x-ray point sources for table-top imaging is illustrated with single shot
  flash radiographs obtained using low laser pulse energy. These results will enable
  the deployment of brighter laser driven x-ray sources at both compact and large
  laser facilities.
