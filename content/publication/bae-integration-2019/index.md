abstract: Hybrid heterostructures are essential for functional device systems. The
  advent of 2D materials has broadened the material set beyond conventional 3D material-based
  heterostructures. It has triggered the fundamental investigation and use in applications
  of new coupling phenomena between 3D bulk materials and 2D atomic layers that have
  unique van der Waals features. Here we review the state-of-the-art fabrication of
  2D and 3D heterostructures, present a critical survey of unique phenomena arising
  from forming 3D/2D interfaces, and introduce their applications. We also discuss
  potential directions for research based on these new coupled architectures.
