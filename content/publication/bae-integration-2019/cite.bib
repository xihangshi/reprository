 abstract = {Hybrid heterostructures are essential for functional device systems. The advent of 2D materials has broadened the material set beyond conventional 3D material-based heterostructures. It has triggered the fundamental investigation and use in applications of new coupling phenomena between 3D bulk materials and 2D atomic layers that have unique van der Waals features. Here we review the state-of-the-art fabrication of 2D and 3D heterostructures, present a critical survey of unique phenomena arising from forming 3D/2D interfaces, and introduce their applications. We also discuss potential directions for research based on these new coupled architectures.},
