abstract: Based on phase retrieval, lensless coherent imaging and in particular holography
  offers quantitative phase and amplitude images. This is of particular importance
  for spectral ranges where suitable lenses are challenging, such as for hard x-rays.
  Here, we propose a phase retrieval approach for inline x-ray holography based on
  Tikhonov regularization applied to the full nonlinear forward model of image formation.
  The approach can be seen as a nonlinear generalization of the well-established contrast
  transfer function (CTF) reconstruction method. While similar methods have been proposed
  before, the current work achieves nonlinear, constrained phase retrieval at competitive
  computation times. We thus enable high-throughput imaging of optically strong objects
  beyond the scope of CTF. Using different examples of inline holograms obtained from
  illumination by a x-ray waveguide-source, we demonstrate superior image quality
  even for samples which do not obey the assumption of a weakly varying phase. Since
  the presented approach does not rely on linearization, we expect it to be well suited
  also for other probes such as visible light or electrons, which often exhibit strong
  phase interaction.
