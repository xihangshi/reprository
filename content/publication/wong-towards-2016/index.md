abstract: Rapid progress in nanofabrication methods has fuelled a quest for ultra-compact
  photonic integrated systems and nanoscale light sources. The prospect of small-footprint,
  high-quality emitters of short-wavelength radiation is especially exciting due to
  the importance of extreme-ultraviolet and X-ray radiation as research and diagnostic
  tools in medicine, engineering and the natural sciences. Here, we propose a highly
  directional, tunable and monochromatic radiation source based on electrons interacting
  with graphene plasmons. Our complementary analytical theory and ab initio simulations
  demonstrate that the high momentum of the strongly confined graphene plasmons enables
  the generation of high-frequency radiation from relatively low-energy electrons,
  bypassing the need for lengthy electron acceleration stages or extreme laser intensities.
  For instance, highly directional 20 keV photons could be generated in a table-top
  design using electrons from conventional radiofrequency electron guns. The conductive
  nature and high damage threshold of graphene make it especially suitable for this
  application. Our electron–plasmon scattering theory is readily extended to other
  systems in which free electrons interact with surface waves.
