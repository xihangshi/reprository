abstract: Pumpâ€“probe electron diffraction and ultrafast microscopy, based on laser
  excitation and probing with electrons, can provide a four-dimensional visualization
  of atomic motion in space and time. Electron pulses consisting of only single electrons
  have recently been used in order to avoid the deterioration of temporal resolution
  by Coulomb forces. Here it is discussed how one can define the pulse duration, the
  beam size and divergence, the transverse and longitudinal coherences, the energy
  spread and temporal dispersion, and the relation between bandwidth and shortest
  possible pulse duration, for single electrons and in practical context. Relations
  are provided on how to estimate these parameters from measurable quantities in a
  single-electron diffraction or microscopy experiment.
