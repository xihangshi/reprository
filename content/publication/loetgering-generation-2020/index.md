abstract: The phenomenon of orbital angular momentum (OAM) affects a variety of important
  applications in visible optics, including optical tweezers, free-space communication,
  and 3D localization for fluorescence imaging. The lack of suitable wavefront shaping
  optics such as spatial light modulators has inhibited the ability to impart OAM
  on x-ray and electron radiation in a controlled way. Here, we report the experimental
  observation of helical soft x-ray beams generated by holographically designed diffractive
  optical elements. We demonstrate that these beams rotate as a function of propagation
  distance and measure their vorticity and coherent mode structure using ptychography.
  Our results establish an approach for controlling and shaping of complex focused
  beams for short wavelength scanning microscopy and OAM-driven applications.
