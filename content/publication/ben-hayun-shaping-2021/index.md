abstract: It is a long-standing goal to create light with unique quantum properties
  such as squeezing and entanglement. We propose the generation of quantum light using
  free-electron interactions, going beyond their already ubiquitous use in generating
  classical light. This concept is motivated by developments in electron microscopy,
  which recently demonstrated quantum free-electron interactions with light in photonic
  cavities. Such electron microscopes provide platforms for shaping quantum states
  of light through a judicious choice of the input light and electron states. Specifically,
  we show how electron energy combs implement photon displacement operations, creating
  displaced-Fock and displaced-squeezed states. We develop the theory for consecutive
  electron-cavity interactions with a common cavity and show how to generate any target
  Fock state. Looking forward, exploiting the degrees of freedom of electrons, light,
  and their interaction may achieve complete control over the quantum state of the
  generated light, leading to novel light statistics and correlations.
