abstract: Spatiotemporal electron-beam shaping is a bold frontier of electron microscopy.
  Over the past decade, shaping methods evolved from static phase plates to low-speed
  electrostatic and magnetostatic displays. Recently, a swift change of paradigm utilizing
  light to control free electrons has emerged. Here, we experimentally demonstrate
  arbitrary transverse modulation of electron beams without complicated electron-optics
  elements or material nanostructures, but rather using shaped light beams. Ondemand
  spatial modulation of electron wavepackets is obtained via inelastic interaction
  with transversely shaped ultrafast light fields controlled by an external spatial
  light modulator. We illustrate this method for the cases of Hermite-Gaussian and
  Laguerre-Gaussian modulation and discuss their use in enhancing microscope sensitivity.
  Our approach dramatically widens the range of patterns that can be imprinted on
  the electron profile and greatly facilitates tailored electron-beam shaping.
