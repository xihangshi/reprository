abstract: We demonstrate, theoretically and experimentally, nonbroadening optical
  beams propagating along any arbitrarily chosen convex trajectory in space. We present
  a general method to construct such beams, and demonstrate it by generating beams
  following polynomial and exponential trajectories. We find that all such beams,
  accelerating along any convex trajectory, display the same universal intensity cross
  section, irrespective of their acceleration. The universal features of these beams
  are explored using catastrophe theory. Â© 2011 American Physical Society.
