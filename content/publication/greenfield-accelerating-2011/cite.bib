 abstract = {We demonstrate, theoretically and experimentally, nonbroadening optical beams propagating along any arbitrarily chosen convex trajectory in space. We present a general method to construct such beams, and demonstrate it by generating beams following polynomial and exponential trajectories. We find that all such beams, accelerating along any convex trajectory, display the same universal intensity cross section, irrespective of their acceleration. The universal features of these beams are explored using catastrophe theory. Â© 2011 American Physical Society.},
