abstract: This article reviews the basic theoretical aspects of graphene, a one-atom-thick
  allotrope of carbon, with unusual two-dimensional Dirac-like electronic excitations.
  The Dirac electrons can be controlled by application of external electric and magnetic
  fields, or by altering sample geometry and/or topology. The Dirac electrons behave
  in unusual ways in tunneling, confinement, and the integer quantum Hall effect.
  The electronic properties of graphene stacks are discussed and vary with stacking
  order and number of layers. Edge (surface) states in graphene depend on the edge
  termination (zigzag or armchair) and affect the physical properties of nanoribbons.
  Different types of disorder modify the Dirac equation leading to unusual spectroscopic
  and transport properties. The effects of electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions
  in single layer and multilayer graphene are also presented. Â© 2009 The American
