 abstract = {It has been possible to produce photon vortex beams — optical beams with spiralling wavefronts — for some time, and they have found widespread application as optical tweezers, in interferometry and in information transfer, for example. The production of vortex beams of electrons was demonstrated earlier this year (http://go.nature.com/4H2xWR) in a procedure involving the passage of electrons through a spiral stack of graphite thin films. The ability to generate such beams reproducibly in a conventional electron microscope would enable many new applications. Now Jo Verbeeck and colleagues have taken a step towards that goal. They describe a versatile holographic technique for generating these twisted electron beams, and demonstrate their potential use as probes of a material's magnetic properties.},
