abstract: It has been possible to produce photon vortex beams — optical beams with
  spiralling wavefronts — for some time, and they have found widespread application
  as optical tweezers, in interferometry and in information transfer, for example.
  The production of vortex beams of electrons was demonstrated earlier this year (http://go.nature.com/4H2xWR)
  in a procedure involving the passage of electrons through a spiral stack of graphite
  thin films. The ability to generate such beams reproducibly in a conventional electron
  microscope would enable many new applications. Now Jo Verbeeck and colleagues have
  taken a step towards that goal. They describe a versatile holographic technique
  for generating these twisted electron beams, and demonstrate their potential use
  as probes of a material's magnetic properties.
