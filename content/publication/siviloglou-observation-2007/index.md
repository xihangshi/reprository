abstract: We report the first observation of Airy optical beams. This intriguing class
  of wave packets, initially predicted by Berry and Balazs in 1979, has been realized
  in both one- and two-dimensional configurations. As demonstrated in our experiments,
  these Airy beams can exhibit unusual features such as the ability to remain diffraction-free
  over long distances while they tend to freely accelerate during propagation. Â© 2007
