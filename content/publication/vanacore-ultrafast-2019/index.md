abstract: Vortex-carrying matter waves, such as chiral electron beams, are of significant
  interest in both applied and fundamental science. Continuous-wave electron vortex
  beams are commonly prepared via passive phase masks imprinting a transverse phase
  modulation on the electron’s wavefunction. Here, we show that femtosecond chiral
  plasmonic near fields enable the generation and dynamic control on the ultrafast
  timescale of an electron vortex beam. The vortex structure of the resulting electron
  wavepacket is probed in both real and reciprocal space using ultrafast transmission
  electron microscopy. This method offers a high degree of scalability to small length
  scales and a highly efficient manipulation of the electron vorticity with attosecond
  precision. Besides the direct implications in the investigation of nanoscale ultrafast
  processes in which chirality plays a major role, we further discuss the perspectives
  of using this technique to shape the wavefunction of charged composite particles,
  such as protons, and how it can be used to probe their internal structure.
