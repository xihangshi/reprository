 abstract = {X-ray imaging produced by parametric X-rays (PXR) is reported. The PXR are generated using an electron beam with energy of 56MeV and currents up to 6.4μA, that interacted with a 1.5-mm thick lithium fluoride (LiF) crystal target in Laue geometry. The LiF (220) crystallographic plane was used with a Bragg angle (θB) near 15° to produce PXR with energy 16.6keV and FWHM of 3%. This intense, directional, and tunable X-ray source was then used to image a small fish, an integrated circuit, and an electrical switch with an intensified CCD camera. The bremsstrahlung from the target crystal is characterized as a source of noise and compared to the PXR.},
