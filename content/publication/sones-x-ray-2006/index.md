abstract: X-ray imaging produced by parametric X-rays (PXR) is reported. The PXR are
  generated using an electron beam with energy of 56MeV and currents up to 6.4μA,
  that interacted with a 1.5-mm thick lithium fluoride (LiF) crystal target in Laue
  geometry. The LiF (220) crystallographic plane was used with a Bragg angle (θB)
  near 15° to produce PXR with energy 16.6keV and FWHM of 3%. This intense, directional,
  and tunable X-ray source was then used to image a small fish, an integrated circuit,
  and an electrical switch with an intensified CCD camera. The bremsstrahlung from
  the target crystal is characterized as a source of noise and compared to the PXR.
