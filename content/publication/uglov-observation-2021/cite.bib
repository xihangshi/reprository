 abstract = {Currently, most of the Cherenkov phenomenon researches for the X-ray region are theoretical studies; there are only a few experiments in this area. Here the new experimental results on observation of X-ray Cherenkov radiation generated by 5.7 MeV electrons in the thin Be and Si foils are presented. The Cherenkov effect from Be was observed for the first time. The experimental results are compared with the calculations performed according to the theoretical model of transition radiation taking into account the oxide layer on the target output surface.},
