abstract: Currently, most of the Cherenkov phenomenon researches for the X-ray region
  are theoretical studies; there are only a few experiments in this area. Here the
  new experimental results on observation of X-ray Cherenkov radiation generated by
  5.7 MeV electrons in the thin Be and Si foils are presented. The Cherenkov effect
  from Be was observed for the first time. The experimental results are compared with
  the calculations performed according to the theoretical model of transition radiation
  taking into account the oxide layer on the target output surface.
