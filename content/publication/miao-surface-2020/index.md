abstract: This paper describes two surface treatments for silicon dual-pillar dielectric
  laser accelerators (DLAs), which increase the laser-induced damage threshold (LIDT)
  and therefore the maximum achievable acceleration gradient. Hydrogen annealing reduces
  the surface roughness of the silicon pillars and mesa, making the LIDT less dependent
  on surface perturbations incurred during fabrication, as well as causing damage
  to occur at predictable locations. Hydrogen annealing decreases the range of the
  measured LIDT from $ 5.3 - 10;rm mJ/cmtextasciicircum2 $5.3−10mJ/cm2 to $ 9.5 -
  10.2;rm mJ/cmtextasciicircum2 $9.5−10.2mJ/cm2 with 1960 nm 300 fs pulses. Additionally,
  90 nm of low-stress silicon nitride film coating on the annealed DLA improves the
  damage fluence by 27%. Smoother interfaces, possibly combined with charge transfer
  from the pillars to the nitride coating, decrease the range of the LIDT and increase
  the damage fluence. The surface-treated DLAs accelerate 97 keV electrons with an
  acceleration gradient of $ 178 pm 1.8;rm MeV/m $178±1.8MeV/m, an increase of 11%
  over the previous maximal gradient achieved with dual-pillar DLAs.
