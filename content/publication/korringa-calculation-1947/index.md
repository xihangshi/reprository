abstract: General formulae for the calculation of the energy E(k) of a Bloch wave
  with reduced wave vector k are obtained by the application of the dynamical theory
  of lattice interferences to electron waves. This method requires the computation
  of the zeros of an infinite determinant which in fair approximation might be replaced
  by a determinant with a few rows and columns only. Its elements are the sum of two
  functions, a function of E and k, resulting from interference of multipole waves
  of free electrons (and therefore independent of the lattice potential), and a function
  of E only, resulting from scattering of free electron waves by the field around
  one atom. Of the latter terms only those in the principal diagonal are of importance.
