abstract: A short review of Cherenkov radiation and its use for particle identification
  with threshold and differential counters is presented. The focusing principles of
  Ring Imaging Cherenkov (RICH) counters are then developed and applied successively
  to gas and liquid radiators. An analysis of proximity focused images from liquid
  or solid radiators follows. A method to reconstruct the Cherenkov angle from the
  experimental data is developed for spherical as well as for flat detector surfaces.
  These formulas define the Cherenkov angle sensitivity due to intrinsic as well as
  extrinsic (measurement) errors. Particle identification limits are then given for
  each of the different imaging methods. Â© 1994.
