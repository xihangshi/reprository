 abstract = {The Weizsäcker‐Williams method is used to calculate the gain due to the induced emission of radiation into a single electromagnetic mode parallel to the motion of a relativistic electron through a periodic transverse dc magnetic field. Finite gain is available from the far‐infrared through the visible region raising the possibility of continuously tunable amplifiers and oscillators at these frequencies with the further possibility of partially coherent radiation sources in the ultraviolet and x‐ray regions to beyond 10 keV. Several numerical examples are considered.},
