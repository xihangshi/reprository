abstract: Spontaneous processes triggered in a sample by free electrons, such as cathodoluminescence,
  are commonly regarded and detected as stochastic events. Here, we supplement this
  picture by showing through first-principles theory that light and free-electron
  pulses can interfere when interacting with a nanostructure, giving rise to a modulation
  in the spectral distribution of the cathodoluminescence light emission that is strongly
  dependent on the electron wave function. Specifically, for a temporally focused
  electron, cathodoluminescence can be canceled upon illumination with a spectrally
  modulated dimmed laser that is phase-locked relative to the electron density profile.
  We illustrate this idea with realistic simulations under attainable conditions in
  currently available ultrafast electron microscopes. We further argue that the interference
  between excitations produced by light and free electrons enables the manipulation
  of the ultrafast materials response by combining the spectral and temporal selectivity
  of the light with the atomic resolution of electron beams.
