abstract: Room temperature, broadly tunable, electrically pumped semiconductor sources
  in the terahertz spectral range, similar in operation simplicity to diode lasers,
  are highly desired for applications. An emerging technology in this area are sources
  based on intracavity difference-frequency generation in dual-wavelength mid-infrared
  quantum cascade lasers. Here we report terahertz quantum cascade laser sources based
  on an optimized non-collinear Cherenkov difference-frequency generation scheme that
  demonstrates dramatic improvements in performance. Devices emitting at 4 THz display
  a mid-infrared-to-terahertz conversion efficiency in excess of 0.6 mW W -2 and provide
  nearly 0.12 mW of peak power output. Devices emitting at 2 and 3 THz fabricated
  on the same chip display 0.09 and 0.4 mW W -2 conversion efficiencies at room temperature,
  respectively. High terahertz-generation efficiency and relaxed phase-matching conditions
  offered by the Cherenkov scheme allowed us to demonstrate, for the first time, an
  external-cavity terahertz quantum cascade laser source tunable between 1.70 and
  5.25 THz. Â© 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.
