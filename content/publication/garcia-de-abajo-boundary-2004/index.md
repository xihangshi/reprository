abstract: The effect of dielectric boundaries on the Cherenkov radiation (CR) produced
  when a fast point charge moves inside or near a material is analyzed for different
  shapes of the sample. Calculations are offered for a charge moving near both planar
  and nonplanar surfaces. CR is found to be produced even when the external charge
  moves outside a semi-infinite medium. For charges moving near planar boundaries,
  the reflected radiation interferes with the direct CR, leading to oscillations in
  the emission probability as a function of the impact parameter relative to the interfaces.
  Thin-film guided modes are excited by penetrating electrons and our calculations
  agree reasonably well with available experiments. The bulk limit in the emission
  probability is recovered for charges passing by the center of cylinders or spheres
  of increasingly large radius. Recent experiments of energy loss of electrons passing
  near dielectric spheres are explained thanks to the inclusion of retardation effects
  in the sphere response. These effects lead to an efficient channel of radiative
  energy losses. Finally, the diffraction of CR in void inclusions is proposed as
  a tool for providing information on otherwise inaccessible buried structures.
