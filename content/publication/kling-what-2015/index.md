abstract: "The quantum regime of the free-electron laser (FEL) emerges when the discreteness
  of the momentum of the electron plays a dominant role in the interaction with the
  laser and the wiggler field. Motivated by a heuristic phase space approach we pursue
  two different routes to define the transition from the classical FEL to the quantum
  domain: (i) standard perturbation theory and (ii) the method of averaging. Moreover,
  we discuss the experimental requirements for realizing a Quantum FEL and connect
  them to today's capabilities."
