abstract: We perform fully relativistic calculations of the energy loss channels for
  a charged particle traversing a single layer of graphene under oblique incidence
  in a setting pertinent to a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM), where
  we distinguish between the energy deposited in graphene in the form of electronic
  excitations (Ohmic loss) and the energy emitted in the far field in the form of
  transition radiation (TR). Our formulation of the problem uses a definition of two
  in-plane, dielectric functions of graphene, which describe the longitudinal and
  transverse excitation processes that contribute separately to those two energy loss
  channels. Using several models for the electric conductivity of graphene as the
  input in those dielectric functions enables us to discuss the effects of oblique
  incidence on several processes in a broad range of frequencies, from the terahertz
  (THz) to the ultraviolet (UV). In particular, at the THz frequencies, we demonstrate
  that the nonlocal effect in the graphene's conductivity is not important in the
  retarded regime, and we show that the longitudinal and transverse contributions
  to the emitted TR spectra exhibit strongly anisotropic angular patterns that are
  readily distinguishable in a cathodoluminescence measurement in a STEM. Moreover,
  we explore the possibility of exciting the so-called transverse mode in the optical
  response of graphene at the mid-infrared (MIR) range of frequencies by means of
  a fast charged particle under oblique incidence. Finally, we demonstrate that, aside
  from the usual high-energy peaks in the longitudinal contribution to the Ohmic energy
  loss in the MIR to the UV frequency range, there may arise strongly directional
  features in the in-plane distribution of the transverse contribution to the Ohmic
  energy loss for an oblique trajectory, which could be possibly observed via momentum-
  and angle-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy of graphene in STEM.
