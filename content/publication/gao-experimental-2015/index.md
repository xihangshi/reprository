abstract: We experimentally demonstrate that an ultrathin metallic spiral structure
  is able to support multiple high-order magnetic localized spoof surface plasmons
  (LSSPs), which were absent in previously reported magnetic LSSPs. Near-field response
  spectra and near-field mapping are performed in the microwave regime to confirm
  this phenomenon. We also show that the high-order magnetic LSSPs are more sensitive
  to the surrounding refractive index change than the previously reported magnetic
  dipole mode. Our study may be useful in electromagnetic near-field sensing from
  microwave to infrared frequencies.
