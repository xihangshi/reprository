 abstract = {Interlayer spacing is expected to influence the properties of multilayer two-dimensional (2D) materials. However, the ability to non-destructively regulate the interlayer spacing bidirectionally and reversibly is challenging. Here we report the preparation of 2D materials with tunable interlayer spacing by introducing active sites (Ce ions) in 2D materials to capture and immobilize Pt single atoms. The strong chemical interaction between active sites and Pt atoms contributes to the intercalation behavior of Pt atoms in the interlayer of 2D materials and further promotes the formation of chemical bonding between Pt atom and host materials. Taking cerium-embedded molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) as an example, intercalation of Pt atoms enables interlayer distance tuning via an electrochemical protocol, leading to interlayer spacing reversible and linear compression and expansion from 6.546 ± 0.039 Å to 5.792 ± 0.038 Å (~11 %). The electronic property evolution with the interlayer spacing variation is demonstrated by the photoluminescence (PL) spectra, delivering that the well-defined barrier between the multilayer and monolayer layered materials can be artificially designed.},
