abstract: Interlayer spacing is expected to influence the properties of multilayer
  two-dimensional (2D) materials. However, the ability to non-destructively regulate
  the interlayer spacing bidirectionally and reversibly is challenging. Here we report
  the preparation of 2D materials with tunable interlayer spacing by introducing active
  sites (Ce ions) in 2D materials to capture and immobilize Pt single atoms. The strong
  chemical interaction between active sites and Pt atoms contributes to the intercalation
  behavior of Pt atoms in the interlayer of 2D materials and further promotes the
  formation of chemical bonding between Pt atom and host materials. Taking cerium-embedded
  molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) as an example, intercalation of Pt atoms enables interlayer
  distance tuning via an electrochemical protocol, leading to interlayer spacing reversible
  and linear compression and expansion from 6.546 ± 0.039 Å to 5.792 ± 0.038 Å (~11
  %). The electronic property evolution with the interlayer spacing variation is demonstrated
  by the photoluminescence (PL) spectra, delivering that the well-defined barrier
  between the multilayer and monolayer layered materials can be artificially designed.
