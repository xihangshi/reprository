abstract: Abstract The invention of optical lasers led to a revolution in the field
  of optics and to the creation of such fields of research as quantum optics. The
  reason was their unique statistical and coherence properties. The emerging, short-wavelength
  free-electron lasers (FELs) are sources of very bright coherent extreme-ultraviolet
  and X-ray radiation with pulse durations on the order of femtoseconds, and are presently
  considered to be laser sources at these energies. FELs are highly spatially coherent
  to the first-order but in spite of their name, behave statistically as chaotic sources.
  Here, we demonstrate experimentally, by combining Hanbury Brown and Twiss interferometry
  with spectral measurements that the seeded XUV FERMI FEL-2 source does indeed behave
  statistically as a laser. The results may be useful for quantum optics experiments
  and for the design and operation of next generation FEL sources.
