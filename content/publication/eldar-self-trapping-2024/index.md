abstract: The interaction of light and swift electrons has enabled phase-coherent
  manipulation and acceleration of electron wavepackets. Here we investigate this
  interaction in a new regime where low-energy electrons (textasciitilde20-200 eV)
  interact with a phase-matched light field. Our analytical and one-dimensional numerical
  study shows that slow electrons are subject to strong confinement in the energy
  domain due to the non-vanishing curvature of the electron dispersion. The spectral
  trap is tunable and an appropriate choice of light field parameters can reduce the
  interaction dynamics to only two energy states. The capacity to trap electrons expands
  the scope of electron beam physics, free-electron quantum optics and quantum simulators.
