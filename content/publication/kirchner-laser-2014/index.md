abstract: Recording electronic motion in atomic systems requires attosecond and picometre
  resolutions. Current attosecond technology provides photon pulses up to an energy
  range of 100 eV, with wavelengths far too long to access structures on the atomic
  scale. In contrast, ultrashort free-electron pulses with sub-Ångstrom de Broglie
  wavelengths offer the potential to resolve sub-atomic structures. Here, we demonstrate
  an optical-field-driven streak camera for their temporal characterization. Our concept
  is to have an electron beam and a laser beam intersect at an ultrathin metal mirror,
  and potentially offers attosecond resolution. The technique will be instrumental
  in advancing ultrafast electron diffraction towards ever higher temporal resolution
  in the pursuit of the long-term goal of sub-atomic four-dimensional imaging. As
  a first application, we study the influence of electron-electron interactions on
  the characteristics of few-electron pulses. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.
