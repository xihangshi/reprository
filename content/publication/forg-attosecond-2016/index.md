abstract: The promise of ultrafast light-field-driven electronic nanocircuits has
  stimulated the development of the new research field of attosecond nanophysics.
  An essential prerequisite for advancing this new area is the ability to characterize
  optical near fields from light interaction with nanostructures, with sub-cycle resolution.
  Here we experimentally demonstrate attosecond near-field retrieval for a tapered
  gold nanowire. By comparison of the results to those obtained from noble gas experiments
  and trajectory simulations, the spectral response of the nanotaper near field arising
  from laser excitation can be extracted.
