abstract: IN a letter to NATURE (vol. 119, p. 558; April 16, 1927, hereafter cited
  as loc. cit), Messrs. Davisson and Germer have communicated the results of some
  very interesting experiments on the scattering of electrons from single crystals
  of nickel. They show that the distribution of scattered electrons, which have only
  lost a small fraction of their energy, depends on the voltage, and is in accordance
  with the symmetry of the crystal. The authors explain their results approximately
  on the basis of the Einstein - de Broglie theory of the wave electron, in a similar
  manner to that suggested by Elsasser (Naturwiss., 13, p. 711, 1925) in explanation
  of earlier experiments of Davisson and Kunsman (Phys. Rev., 22, p. 243, 1923). In
  particular, the explanation given is that electrons of velocity v are scattered
  by the nickel crystal in very nearly the same directions as those in which an electromagnetic
  wave of wave - length λe = h/mv would be diffracted by the cross grating formed
  by the uppermost layer of atoms in the face of the crystal—in this case, a (111)
  face which has been etched by vaporisation.
