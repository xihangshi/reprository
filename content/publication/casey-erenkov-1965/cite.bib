 abstract = {The formal exact solution to the problem of the radiation of a charged particle traveling with a constant velocity in a periodically inhomogeneous medium is obtained. As a specific example; the case with a sinusoidally varying dielectric profile is treated in detail. Results of the computation are summarized in two graphs from which information concerning threshold velocity for a particular mode; the emission angles for various radiating modes; and the cutoff frequency for a certain mode can be found. Unlike the case of Cerenkov radiation in a homogeneous medium; there exist radiating modes in this inhomogeneous-dielectric case even when the velocity of the charged particle is below the threshold ÄŒerenkov velocity. A formal expression for the radiation spectrum is also given. Approximate expressions for the radiated fields and for the radiation spectrum are obtained when the variation of the permittivity is small. Results are discussed and interpreted.},
