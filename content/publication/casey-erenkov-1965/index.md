abstract: The formal exact solution to the problem of the radiation of a charged particle
  traveling with a constant velocity in a periodically inhomogeneous medium is obtained.
  As a specific example; the case with a sinusoidally varying dielectric profile is
  treated in detail. Results of the computation are summarized in two graphs from
  which information concerning threshold velocity for a particular mode; the emission
  angles for various radiating modes; and the cutoff frequency for a certain mode
  can be found. Unlike the case of Cerenkov radiation in a homogeneous medium; there
  exist radiating modes in this inhomogeneous-dielectric case even when the velocity
  of the charged particle is below the threshold ÄŒerenkov velocity. A formal expression
  for the radiation spectrum is also given. Approximate expressions for the radiated
  fields and for the radiation spectrum are obtained when the variation of the permittivity
  is small. Results are discussed and interpreted.
