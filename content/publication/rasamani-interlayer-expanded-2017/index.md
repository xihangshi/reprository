abstract: Motivated by the novel properties of two-dimensional materials, MoS2 has
  been extensively explored with discoveries surging in the recent years. Such impressive
  progress benefits from the success in synthesizing nanostructured MoS2 with precisely
  controlled parameters including edge density and crystalline phase. In this review,
  we focus on the synthesis of MoS2 with expanded interlayer spacing and their applications
  in energy storage, catalysis and environmental remediation, highlighting the importance
  of tuning interlayer spacing on improving performance of MoS2. The challenges faced
  in this emerging research area and perspective research directions are also discussed.
