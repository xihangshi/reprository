abstract: Abstract Ultrafast photon–electron spectroscopy in electron microscopes
  commonly requires ultrafast laser setups. Photoemission from an engineered electron
  source is used to generate pulsed electrons, interacting with a sample excited by
  the laser pulse at a known time delay. Thus, developing an ultrafast electron microscope
  demands the exploitation of extrinsic laser excitations and complex synchronization
  schemes. Here we present an inverse approach to introduce internal radiation sources
  in an electron microscope based on cathodoluminescence spectroscopy. Our compact
  method is based on a sequential interaction of the electron beam with an electron-driven
  photon source and the investigated sample. Such a source in an electron microscope
  generates phase-locked photons that are mutually coherent with the near-field distribution
  of the swift electron. We confirm the mutual frequency and momentum-dependent correlation
  of the electron-driven photon source and sample radiation and determine a degree
  of mutual coherence of up to 27%. With this level of mutual coherence, we were able
  to perform spectral interferometry with an electron microscope. Our method has the
  advantage of being simple, compact and operating with continuous electron beams.
  It will open the door to local photon–electron correlation spectroscopy of quantum
  materials, single-photon systems and coherent exciton–polaritonic samples with nanometre
  resolution.
