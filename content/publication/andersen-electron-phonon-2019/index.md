abstract: Understanding and controlling nonequilibrium electronic phenomena is an
  outstanding challenge in science and engineering. By electrically driving ultraclean
  graphene devices out of equilibrium, we observe an instability that is manifested
  as substantially enhanced current fluctuations and suppressed conductivity at microwave
  frequencies. Spatial mapping of the nonequilibrium current fluctuations using nanoscale
  magnetic field sensors reveals that the fluctuations grow exponentially along the
  direction of carrier flow. Our observations, including the dependence on density
  and temperature, are consistently explained by the emergence of an electron-phonon
  Cerenkov instability at supersonic drift velocities. These results offer the opportunity
  for tunable terahertz generation and active phononic devices based on two-dimensional
  materials.
