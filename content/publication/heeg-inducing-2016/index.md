abstract: Up to now, experiments involving Mössbauer nuclei driven by x-rays have
  been restricted to the low-excitation regime. Here, a setup is proposed which promises
  significant excitation, ideally exceeding full inversion of the nuclear ensemble,
  at x-ray light sources under construction. We further introduce a method to experimentally
  verify such inversions, in which population inversions manifest themselves in symmetry
  flips of suitably recorded spectra. It neither requires per-shot spectra of the
  incoming x-ray pulses, nor absolute measurements of the scattered light intensity.
