abstract: Entanglement goes large The success of quantum computing relies on the ability
  to entangle large-scale systems. Various platforms are being pursued, with architectures
  based on superconducting qubits and trapped atoms being the most advanced. By entangling
  up to 20 qubits, Omran et al. and Song et al. —working with Rydberg atom qubits
  and superconducting qubits, respectively—demonstrate how far these platforms have
  reached. The demonstrated controllable generation and detection of entanglement
  on such quantum systems is promising for the development of large-scale quantum
  processors. Science , this issue p. 570 , p. 574 , Entanglement of up to 20 qubits
  is achieved in superconducting and trapped atom platforms. , Quantum entanglement
  involving coherent superpositions of macroscopically distinct states is among the
  most striking features of quantum theory, but its realization is challenging because
  such states are extremely fragile. Using a programmable quantum simulator based
  on neutral atom arrays with interactions mediated by Rydberg states, we demonstrate
  the creation of “Schrödinger cat” states of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)
  type with up to 20 qubits. Our approach is based on engineering the energy spectrum
  and using optimal control of the many-body system. We further demonstrate entanglement
  manipulation by using GHZ states to distribute entanglement to distant sites in
  the array, establishing important ingredients for quantum information processing
  and quantum metrology.
