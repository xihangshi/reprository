abstract: Tunneling is one of the most fundamental and ubiquitous processes in the
  quantum world. The question of how long a particle takes to tunnel through a potential
  barrier has sparked a long-standing debate since the early days of quantum mechanics.
  Here, we propose and demonstrate a novel scheme to accurately determine the tunneling
  time of an electron. In this scheme, a weak laser field is used to streak the tunneling
  current produced by a strong elliptically polarized laser field in an attoclock
  configuration, allowing us to retrieve the tunneling ionization time relative to
  the field maximum with a precision of a few attoseconds. This overcomes the difficulties
  in previous attoclock measurements wherein the Coulomb effect on the photoelectron
  momentum distribution has to be removed with theoretical models and it requires
  accurate information of the driving laser fields. We demonstrate that the tunneling
  time of an electron from an atom is close to zero within our experimental accuracy.
  Our study represents a straightforward approach toward attosecond time-resolved
  imaging of electron motion in atoms and molecules.
