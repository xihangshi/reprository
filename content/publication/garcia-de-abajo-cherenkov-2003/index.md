abstract: Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) is shown to be an excellent source
  of information both on photonic crystal bands and on radiation modes of complex
  nanostructures. Good agreement is reported between measurements and parameter-free
  calculations of EELS in porous alumina films, where Cherenkov radiation is scattered
  by the pores to yield a strong 8.3-eV (7-eV) feature for 120-keV (200-keV) electrons.
  The latter is related to the bands of two-dimensional photonic crystals formed by
  air cylinders in an alumina matrix with similar near-range ordering. Finally, the
  band structure is proved to be directly mapped by angle-resolved EELS. © 2003 The
