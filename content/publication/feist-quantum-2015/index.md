abstract: Coherent manipulation of quantum systems with light is expected to be a
  cornerstone of future information and communication technology, including quantum
  computation and cryptography. The transfer of an optical phase onto a quantum wavefunction
  is a defining aspect of coherent interactions and forms the basis of quantum state
  preparation, synchronization and metrology. Light-phase-modulated electron states
  near atoms and molecules are essential for the techniques of attosecond science,
  including the generation of extreme-ultraviolet pulses and orbital tomography. In
  contrast, the quantum-coherent phase-modulation of energetic free-electron beams
  has not been demonstrated, although it promises direct access to ultrafast imaging
  and spectroscopy with tailored electron pulses on the attosecond scale. Here we
  demonstrate the coherent quantum state manipulation of free-electron populations
  in an electron microscope beam. We employ the interaction of ultrashort electron
  pulses with optical near-fields to induce Rabi oscillations in the populations of
  electron momentum states, observed as a function of the optical driving field. Excellent
  agreement with the scaling of an equal-Rabi multilevel quantum ladder is obtained,
  representing the observation of a light-driven 'quantum walk' coherently reshaping
  electron density in momentum space. We note that, after the interaction, the optically
  generated superposition of momentum states evolves into a train of attosecond electron
  pulses. Our results reveal the potential of quantum control for the precision structuring
  of electron densities, with possible applications ranging from ultrafast electron
  spectroscopy and microscopy to accelerator science and free-electron lasers.
