abstract: We report the first experimental realization of a three-dimensional thermal
  cloak shielding an air bubble in a bulk metal without disturbing the external conductive
  thermal flux. The cloak is made of a thin layer of homogeneous and isotropic material
  with specially designed three-dimensional manufacturing. The cloak‚Äôs thickness is
  100‚Äâ‚Äâùúá‚Å¢m while the cloaked air bubble has a diameter of 1 cm, achieving the ratio
  between dimensions of the cloak and the cloaked object 2 orders smaller than previous
  thermal cloaks, which were mainly realized in a two-dimensional geometry. This work
  can find applications in novel thermal devices in the three-dimensional physical
  space.
