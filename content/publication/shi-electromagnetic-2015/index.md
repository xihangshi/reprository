abstract: Abstract  It has been shown that a spherical invisibility cloak originally
  proposed by Pendry et al. can be electromagnetically detected by shooting a charged
  particle through it, whose underlying mechanism stems from the asymmetry of transformation
  optics applied to motions of photons and charges [PRL 103, 243901 (2009)]. However,
  the conceptual three-dimensional invisibility cloak that exactly follows specifications
  of transformation optics is formidably difficult to implement, while the simplified
  cylindrical cloak that has been experimentally realized is inherently visible. On
  the other hand, the recent carpet cloak model has acquired remarkable experimental
  development, including a recently demonstrated full-parameter carpet cloak without
  any approximation in the required constitutive parameters. In this paper, we numerically
  investigate the electromagnetic radiation from a charged particle passing through
  a perfect carpet cloak and propose an experimentally verifiable model to demonstrate
  symmetry breaking of transformation optics.
