abstract: We exploit a plasmon mediated two-step momentum down-conversion scheme to
  convert low-energy tunneling electrons into propagating photons. Surface plasmon
  polaritons (SPPs) propagating along an extended gold nanowire are excited on one
  end by low-energy electron tunneling and are then converted to free-propagating
  photons at the other end. The separation of excitation and outcoupling proves that
  tunneling electrons excite gap plasmons that subsequently couple to propagating
  plasmons. Our work shows that electron tunneling provides a nonoptical, voltage-controlled,
  and low-energy pathway for launching SPPs in nanostructures, such as plasmonic waveguides.
