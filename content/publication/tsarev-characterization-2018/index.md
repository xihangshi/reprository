abstract: We consider analytically and numerically the emission of coherent transition
  radiation by few-femtosecond and attosecond electron pulses. With optimized geometries
  based on tilted surfaces we avoid the influences of the beam diameter and velocity
  mismatch for sub-relativistic pulses. We predict the emission of visible and ultraviolet
  optical radiation that characterizes few-femtosecond or attosecond electron pulses
  in time. The total amount of radiation depends on the source' repetition rate and
  number of electrons per macro/microbunch and is in many cases sufficient for pulse
  length characterization in the emerging experiments.
