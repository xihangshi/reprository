abstract: X-ray microbeams are an emerging characterization tool with broad implications
  for science, ranging from materials structure and dynamics, to geophysics and environmental
  science, to biophysics and protein crystallography. We describe how submicrometer
  hard x-ray beams with the ability to penetrate tens to hundreds of micrometers into
  most materials and with the ability to determine local composition, chemistry, and
  (crystal) structure can characterize buried sample volumes and small samples in
  their natural or extreme environments. Beams less than 10 nanometers have already
  been demonstrated, and the practical limit for hard x-ray beam size, the limit to
  trace-element sensitivity, and the ultimate limitations associated with near-atomic
  structure determinations are the subject of ongoing research.
