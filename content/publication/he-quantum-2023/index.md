abstract: Entangled biphoton sources exhibit nonclassical characteristics and have
  been applied to imaging techniques such as ghost imaging, quantum holography, and
  quantum optical coherence tomography. The development of wide-field quantum imaging
  to date has been hindered by low spatial resolutions, speeds, and contrast-to-noise
  ratios (CNRs). Here, we present quantum microscopy by coincidence (QMC) with balanced
  pathlengths, which enables super-resolution imaging at the Heisenberg limit with
  substantially higher speeds and CNRs than existing wide-field quantum imaging methods.
  QMC benefits from a configuration with balanced pathlengths, where a pair of entangled
  photons traversing symmetric paths with balanced optical pathlengths in two arms
  behave like a single photon with half the wavelength, leading to a two-fold resolution
  improvement. Concurrently, QMC resists stray light up to 155 times stronger than
  classical signals. The low intensity and entanglement features of biphotons in QMC
  promise nondestructive bioimaging. QMC advances quantum imaging to the microscopic
  level with significant improvements in speed and CNR toward the bioimaging of cancer
  cells. We experimentally and theoretically prove that the configuration with balanced
  pathlengths illuminates an avenue for quantum-enhanced coincidence imaging at the
  Heisenberg limit.
