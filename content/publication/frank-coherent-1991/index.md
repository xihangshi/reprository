abstract: In 1934 P. A. Čerenkov has discovered a peculiar phenomenon, whicd he has
  since investigated in detail (1). All liquids and solids if bombarded by fast electrons,
  such as $β$-electrons or Compton electrons produced by $γ$-rays, do emit a peculiar
  visible radiation, quite different from the eventual ordinary flourescence. This
  radiation is partially polarized, the electric oscillation vector being parallel
  to the electron beam, and its intensity can be reduced neither by temperature nor
  by addition to the liquid bombarded of quenching substances. The peculiarity of
  these carac-teristics was scrutinized by Wawilow (2) who suggested that this radiation
  must be connected with the «Bremsung» of fast electrons. Since then a new and undoubtedly
  the most peculiar characteristic of the phenomenon was discovered, namely, its highly
  pronounced asymmetry, the intensity of light emitted, in the direction of the motion
  of electrons being many times larger than in the backward direction. It follows
  that the substance bombarded radiates coherently for the space of at least one wavelength
  of the visible light.
