abstract: Electron sources in the form of one-dimensional nanotubes and nanowires
  are an essential tool for investigations in a variety of fields, such as X-ray computed
  tomography, flexible displays, chemical sensors and electron optics applications.
  However, field emission instability and the need to work under high-vacuum or high-temperature
  conditions have imposed stringent requirements that are currently limiting the range
  of application of electron sources. Here we report the fabrication of a LaB6 nanowire
  with only a few La atoms bonded on the tip that emits collimated electrons from
  a single point with high monochromaticity. The nanostructured tip has a low work
  function of 2.07 eV (lower than that of Cs) while remaining chemically inert, two
  properties usually regarded as mutually exclusive. Installed in a scanning electron
  microscope (SEM) field emission gun, our tip shows a current density gain that is
  about 1,000 times greater than that achievable with W(310) tips, and no emission
  decay for tens of hours of operation. Using this new SEM, we acquired very low-noise,
  high-resolution images together with rapid chemical compositional mapping using
  a tip operated at room temperature and at 10-times higher residual gas pressure
  than that required for W tips.
