 abstract = {Two studies of electrons generated from laser-triggered emitters have found highly predictable electronâ€“electron energy correlations. These studies, at vastly different energy scales, may lead to heralded electron sources, enabling quantum free-electron optics and low-noise, low-damage electron beam lithography and microscopy.},
