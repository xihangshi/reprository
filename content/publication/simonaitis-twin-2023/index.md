abstract: Two studies of electrons generated from laser-triggered emitters have found
  highly predictable electronâ€“electron energy correlations. These studies, at vastly
  different energy scales, may lead to heralded electron sources, enabling quantum
  free-electron optics and low-noise, low-damage electron beam lithography and microscopy.
