abstract: X-ray tomography at the level of single biological cells is possible in
  a low-dose regime, based on full-field holographic recordings, with phase contrast
  originating from free-space wave propagation. Building upon recent progress in cellular
  imaging based on the illumination by quasi-point sources provided by X-ray waveguides,
  here this approach is extended in several ways. First, the phase-retrieval algorithms
  are extended by an optimized deterministic inversion, based on a multi-distance
  recording. Second, different advanced forms of iterative phase retrieval are used,
  operational for single-distance and multi-distance recordings. Results are compared
  for several different preparations of macrophage cells, for different staining and
  labelling. As a result, it is shown that phase retrieval is no longer a bottleneck
  for holographic imaging of cells, and how advanced schemes can be implemented to
  cope also with high noise and inconsistencies in the data.
