abstract: With advances in exfoliation and synthetic techniques, atomically thin films
  of semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides have recently been isolated and
  characterized. Their two-dimensional structure, coupled with a direct band gap in
  the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, suggests suitability for digital
  electronics and optoelectronics. Toward that end, several classes of high-performance
  devices have been reported along with significant progress in understanding their
  physical properties. Here, we present a review of the architecture, operating principles,
  and physics of electronic and optoelectronic devices based on ultrathin transition
  metal dichalcogenide semiconductors. By critically assessing and comparing the performance
  of these devices with competing technologies, the merits and shortcomings of this
  emerging class of electronic materials are identified, thereby providing a roadmap
  for future development. Â© 2014 American Chemical Society.
