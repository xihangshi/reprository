abstract: InGaN multi-quantum-well (MQW) structure laser diodes (LDs) fabricated from
  III-V nitride materials were grown by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition on
  sapphire substrates. The mirror facet for a laser cavity was formed by etching of
  III-V nitride films without cleaving. As an active layer, the InGaN MQW structure
  was used. The InGaN MQW LDs produced 215 mW at a forward current of 2.3 A, with
  a sharp peak of light output at 417 nm that had a full width at half-maximum of
  1.6 nm under the pulsed current injection at room temperature. The laser threshold
  current density was 4 kA/cm2. The emission wavelength is the shortest one ever generated
  by a semiconductor laser diode.
