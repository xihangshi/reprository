 abstract = {InGaN multi-quantum-well (MQW) structure laser diodes (LDs) fabricated from III-V nitride materials were grown by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition on sapphire substrates. The mirror facet for a laser cavity was formed by etching of III-V nitride films without cleaving. As an active layer, the InGaN MQW structure was used. The InGaN MQW LDs produced 215 mW at a forward current of 2.3 A, with a sharp peak of light output at 417 nm that had a full width at half-maximum of 1.6 nm under the pulsed current injection at room temperature. The laser threshold current density was 4 kA/cm2. The emission wavelength is the shortest one ever generated by a semiconductor laser diode.},
