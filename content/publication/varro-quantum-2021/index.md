abstract: The interaction of electrons with strong laser fields is usually treated
  with semiclassical theory, where the laser is represented by an external field.
  There are analytic solutions for the free electron wave functions, which incorporate
  the interaction with the laser field exactly, but the joint effect of the atomic
  binding potential presents an obstacle for the analysis. Moreover, the radiation
  is a dynamical system, the number of photons changes during the interactions. Thus,
  it is legitimate to ask how can one treat the high order processes nonperturbatively,
  in such a way that the electron-atom interaction and the quantized nature of radiation
  be simultaneously taken into account? An analytic method is proposed to answer this
  question in the framework of nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics. As an application,
  a quantum optical generalization of the strong-field Kramers-Heisenberg formula
  is derived for describing high-harmonic generation. Our formalism is suitable to
  analyse, among various quantal effects, the possible role of arbitrary photon statistics
  of the incoming field. The present paper is dedicated to the memory of Prof. Dr.
  Fritz Ehlotzky, who had significantly contributed to the theory of strong-field
  phenomena over many decades.
