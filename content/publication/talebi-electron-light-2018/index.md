abstract: The adiabatic approximation has formed the basis for much of our understandings
  of the interaction of light and electrons. The classical nonrecoil approximation
  or quantum mechanical Wolkow states of free-electron waves have been routinely employed
  to interpret the outcomes of low-loss electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) or
  electron holography. Despite the enormous success of semianalytical approximations,
  there are certainly ranges of electron–photon coupling strengths where more demanding
  self-consistent analyses are to be exploited to thoroughly grasp our experimental
  results. Slow-electron point-projection microscopes and many of the photoemission
  experiments are employed within such ranges. Here, we aim to classify those regimes
  and propose numerical solutions for an accurate simulation model. A survey of the
  works carried out within self-consistent Maxwell–Lorentz and Maxwell– Schrödinger
  frameworks are outlined. Several applications of the proposed frameworks are discussed,
  and an outlook for further investigations is also delivered.
