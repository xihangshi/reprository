abstract: "Abstract This work presents a general framework for quantum interference
  between processes that can involve different fundamental particles or quasi-particles.
  This framework shows that shaping input wavefunctions is a versatile and powerful
  tool for producing and controlling quantum interference between distinguishable
  pathways, beyond previously explored quantum interference between indistinguishable
  pathways. Two examples of quantum interference enabled by shaping in interactions
  between free electrons, bound electrons, and photons are presented: i) the vanishing
  of the zero-loss peak by destructive quantum interference when a shaped electron
  wavepacket couples to light, under conditions where the electron's zero-loss peak
  otherwise dominates; ii) quantum interference between free electron and atomic (bound
  electron) spontaneous emission processes, which can be significant even when the
  free electron and atom are far apart, breaking the common notion that a free electron
  and an atom must be close by to significantly affect each other's processes. Conclusions
  show that emerging quantum wave-shaping techniques unlock the door to greater versatility
  in light-matter interactions and other quantum processes in general."
