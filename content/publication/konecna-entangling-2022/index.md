abstract: The inelastic interaction between flying particles and optical nanocavities
  gives rise to entangled states in which some excitations of the latter are paired
  with momentum changes in the former. Specifically, free-electron entanglement with
  nanocavity modes opens appealing opportunities associated with the strong interaction
  capabilities of the electrons. However, the achievable degree of entanglement is
  currently limited by the lack of control over the resulting state mixtures. Here,
  we propose a scheme to generate pure entanglement between designated optical-cavity
  excitations and separable free-electron states. We shape the electron wave function
  profile to select the accessible cavity modes and simultaneously associate them
  with targeted electron scattering directions. This concept is exemplified through
  theoretical calculations of free-electron entanglement with degenerate and nondegenerate
  plasmon modes in silver nanoparticles and atomic vibrations in an inorganic molecule.
  The generated entanglement can be further propagated through its electron component
  to extend quantum interactions beyond existing protocols. Quantum entanglement between
  free electrons and nanoscale optical excitations is achieved by shaping the electron
  wave function.
