 abstract = {Abstract Parametric and coherent Bremsstrahlung radiation of a fast charged particle, moving in a crystal is studied from a single point of view. Such an approach permits to observe the essential change of the radiation structure in the region where CBR and PXR radiation patterns overlap that may be interpreted as an interference of these two radiation mechanisms. The dependence of interference items from charge sign is predicted. The PXR expression admitting a continuous transition from the dynamic regime of radiation to the kinematic one and the parameter of this transition are given.},
