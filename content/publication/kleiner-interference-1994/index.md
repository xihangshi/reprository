abstract: Abstract Parametric and coherent Bremsstrahlung radiation of a fast charged
  particle, moving in a crystal is studied from a single point of view. Such an approach
  permits to observe the essential change of the radiation structure in the region
  where CBR and PXR radiation patterns overlap that may be interpreted as an interference
  of these two radiation mechanisms. The dependence of interference items from charge
  sign is predicted. The PXR expression admitting a continuous transition from the
  dynamic regime of radiation to the kinematic one and the parameter of this transition
  are given.
