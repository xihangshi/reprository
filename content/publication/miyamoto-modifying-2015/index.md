abstract: We propose a transient interlayer compression in two-dimensional compound
  materials by using an intense IR laser resonant with the out-of-plane optical phonon
  mode (A2u mode). As a test case, we studied bilayer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN),
  which is one of the compound layered materials. Excited state molecular dynamics
  calculations using time-dependent density functional theory show an 11.3% transient
  interlayer contraction of h-BN due to an interlayer dipole-dipole attraction of
  the laser-pumped A2u mode. These results are applicable to other layered compound
  materials. Such layered materials are a good material for nanospace chemistry, e.g.,
  intercalating molecules and acting with them, and IR irradiation to contract the
  interlayer distance could provide a new route for chemical reactions under pressure.
  The duration of the contraction is at least 1 ps in the current simulation, which
  is observable by high-speed electron-beam diffraction measurements.
