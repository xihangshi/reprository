abstract: Cherenkov detectors enable a valuable tool to identify high-energy particles.
  However, their sensitivity and momentum coverage are limited by the refractive index
  of host materials. Especially, identifying particles with energy above multiple
  gigaelectronvolts requires host materials with a near-unity refractive index, which
  are limited to bulky gas chambers. Overcoming this fundamental material limit is
  important for future particle detectors yet remains a long-standing challenge. Here,
  we propose a different paradigm for Cherenkov detectors that utilizes the broadband
  angular filter made from stacks of variable one-dimensional photonic crystals. Owing
  to the Brewster effect, the angular filter is transparent only to Cherenkov photons
  from a precise incident angle. Particle identification is achieved by mapping each
  Cherenkov angle to the peak-intensity position of transmitted photons in the detection
  plane. Such angular filtering effect, although decreases the photon number collected
  in the detection plane, enables the realization of a non-dispersive pseudo refractive
  index over the entire visible spectrum. Moreover, the pseudo refractive index can
  be flexibly designed to different values close to unity. Our angular-selective Brewster
  paradigm offers a feasible solution to implement compact and highly sensitive Cherenkov
  detectors especially in beam lines with a small angular divergence using regular
  dielectrics.
