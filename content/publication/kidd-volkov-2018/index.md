abstract: An efficient and accurate basis comprised of Volkov states is implemented
  and tested for time-dependent simulations of interactions between strong laser pulses
  and crystalline solids. The Volkov states are eigenstates of the free electron Hamiltonian
  in an electromagnetic field and analytically represent the rapidly oscillating time-dependence
  of the orbitals, allowing significantly faster time propagation than conventional
  approaches. The Volkov approach can be readily implemented in plane-wave codes by
  multiplying the potential energy matrix elements with a simple time-dependent phase
  factor.
