Faraday rotation is a fundamental effect in the magneto-optical response of solids, liquids and gases. Materials with a large Verdet constant find applications in optical modulators, sensors and non-reciprocal devices, such as optical isolators. Here, we demonstrate that the plane of polarization of light exhibits a giant Faraday rotation of several degrees around the A exciton transition in hBN-encapsulated monolayers of WSe

and MoSe

under moderate magnetic fields. This results in the highest known Verdet constant of -1.9 × 10

for any material in the visible regime. Additionally, interlayer excitons in hBN-encapsulated bilayer MoS

exhibit a large Verdet constant (
