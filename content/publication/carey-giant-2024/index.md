abstract: Abstract  Faraday rotation is a fundamental effect in the magneto-optical
  response of solids, liquids and gases. Materials with a large Verdet constant find
  applications in optical modulators, sensors and non-reciprocal devices, such as
  optical isolators. Here, we demonstrate that the plane of polarization of light
  exhibits a giant Faraday rotation of several degrees around the A exciton transition
  in hBN-encapsulated monolayers of WSe 2 and MoSe 2 under moderate magnetic fields.
  This results in the highest known Verdet constant of -1.9 × 10 7 deg T −1 cm −1
  for any material in the visible regime. Additionally, interlayer excitons in hBN-encapsulated
  bilayer MoS 2 exhibit a large Verdet constant ( V IL ≈ +2 × 10 5 deg T −1 cm −2
  ) of opposite sign compared to A excitons in monolayers. The giant Faraday rotation
  is due to the giant oscillator strength and high g -factor of the excitons in atomically
  thin semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides. We deduce the complete in-plane
  complex dielectric tensor of hBN-encapsulated WSe 2 and MoSe 2 monolayers, which
  is vital for the prediction of Kerr, Faraday and magneto-circular dichroism spectra
  of 2D heterostructures. Our results pose a crucial advance in the potential usage
  of two-dimensional materials in ultrathin optical polarization devices.
