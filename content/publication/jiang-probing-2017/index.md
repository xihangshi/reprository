abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are a group of layered 2D semiconductors
  that have shown many intriguing electrical and optical properties. However, the
  thermal transport properties in TMDs are not well understood due to the challenges
  in characterizing anisotropic thermal conductivity. Here, a variable-spot-size time-domain
  thermoreflectance approach is developed to simultaneously measure both the in-plane
  and the through-plane thermal conductivity of four kinds of layered TMDs (MoS2,
  WS2, MoSe2, and WSe2) over a wide temperature range, 80?300 K. Interestingly, it
  is found that both the through-plane thermal conductivity and the Al/TMD interface
  conductance depend on the modulation frequency of the pump beam for all these four
  compounds. The frequency-dependent thermal properties are attributed to the nonequilibrium
  thermal resistance between the different groups of phonons in the substrate. A two-channel
  thermal model is used to analyze the nonequilibrium phonon transport and to derive
  the intrinsic thermal conductivity at the thermal equilibrium limit. The measurements
  of the thermal conductivities of bulk TMDs serve as an important benchmark for understanding
  the thermal conductivity of single- and few-layer TMDs.
