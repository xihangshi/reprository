abstract: Abstract Integrated photonics facilitates extensive control over fundamental
  light–matter interactions in manifold quantum systems including atoms 1 , trapped
  ions 2,3 , quantum dots 4 and defect centres 5 . Ultrafast electron microscopy has
  recently made free-electron beams the subject of laser-based quantum manipulation
  and characterization 6–11 , enabling the observation of free-electron quantum walks
  12–14 , attosecond electron pulses 10,15–17 and holographic electromagnetic imaging
  18 . Chip-based photonics 19,20 promises unique applications in nanoscale quantum
  control and sensing but remains to be realized in electron microscopy. Here we merge
  integrated photonics with electron microscopy, demonstrating coherent phase modulation
  of a continuous electron beam using a silicon nitride microresonator. The high-finesse
  ( Q 0 ≈ 10 6 ) cavity enhancement and a waveguide designed for phase matching lead
  to efficient electron–light scattering at extremely low, continuous-wave optical
  powers. Specifically, we fully deplete the initial electron state at a cavity-coupled
  power of only 5.35 microwatts and generate textgreater500 electron energy sidebands
  for several milliwatts. Moreover, we probe unidirectional intracavity fields with
  microelectronvolt resolution in electron-energy-gain spectroscopy 21 . The fibre-coupled
  photonic structures feature single-optical-mode electron–light interaction with
  full control over the input and output light. This approach establishes a versatile
  and highly efficient framework for enhanced electron beam control in the context
  of laser phase plates 22 , beam modulators and continuous-wave attosecond pulse
  trains 23 , resonantly enhanced spectroscopy 24–26 and dielectric laser acceleration
  19,20,27 . Our work introduces a universal platform for exploring free-electron
  quantum optics 28–31 , with potential future developments in strong coupling, local
  quantum probing and electron–photon entanglement.
