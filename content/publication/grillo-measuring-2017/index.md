abstract: Abstract Electron waves that carry orbital angular momentum (OAM) are characterized
  by a quantized and unbounded magnetic dipole moment parallel to their propagation
  direction. When interacting with magnetic materials, the wavefunctions of such electrons
  are inherently modified. Such variations therefore motivate the need to analyse
  electron wavefunctions, especially their wavefronts, to obtain information regarding
  the material’s structure. Here, we propose, design and demonstrate the performance
  of a device based on nanoscale holograms for measuring an electron’s OAM components
  by spatially separating them. We sort pure and superposed OAM states of electrons
  with OAM values of between −10 and 10. We employ the device to analyse the OAM spectrum
  of electrons that have been affected by a micron-scale magnetic dipole, thus establishing
  that our sorter can be an instrument for nanoscale magnetic spectroscopy.
