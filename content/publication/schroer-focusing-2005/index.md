abstract: We address the question of what is the smallest spot size that hard x rays
  can be focused to using refractive optics. A thick refractive x-ray lens is considered,
  whose aperture is gradually (adiabatically) adapted to the size of the beam as it
  converges to the focus. These adiabatically focusing lenses are shown to have a
  relatively large numerical aperture, focusing hard x rays down to a lateral size
  of 2 nm (FWHM), well below the theoretical limit for focusing with waveguides [C.
