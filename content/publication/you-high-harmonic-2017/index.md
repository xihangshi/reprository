abstract: Abstract High-harmonic generation in isolated atoms and molecules has been
  widely utilized in extreme ultraviolet photonics and attosecond pulse metrology.
  Recently, high-harmonic generation has been observed in solids, which could lead
  to important applications such as all-optical methods to image valance charge density
  and reconstruct electronic band structures, as well as compact extreme ultraviolet
  light sources. So far these studies are confined to crystalline solids; therefore,
  decoupling the respective roles of long-range periodicity and high density has been
  challenging. Here we report the observation of high-harmonic generation from amorphous
  fused silica. We decouple the role of long-range periodicity by comparing harmonics
  generated from fused silica and crystalline quartz, which contain the same atomic
  constituents but differ in long-range periodicity. Our results advance current understanding
  of the strong-field processes leading to high-harmonic generation in solids with
  implications for the development of robust and compact extreme ultraviolet light
  sources.
