abstract: We demonstrate the transfer of information encoded as orbital angular momentum
  (OAM) states of a light beam. The transmitter and receiver units are based on spatial
  light modulators, which prepare or measure a laser beam in one of eight pure OAM
  states. We show that the information encoded in this way is resistant to eavesdropping
  in the sense that any attempt to sample the beam away from its axis will be subject
  to an angular restriction and a lateral offset, both of which result in inherent
  uncertainty in the measurement. This gives an experimental insight into the effects
  of aperturing and misalignment of the beam on the OAMmeasurement and demonstrates
  the uncertainty relationship for OAM.
