 abstract = {A two-dimensionally confining x-ray channel waveguide structure is combined with a high gain Kirkpatrick-Baez prefocusing mirror system yielding a hard x-ray beam with a cross section of 25 × 47 nm2 (FWHM). Unlike the previously employed resonant beam coupling scheme, the incoming beam is coupled in from the front side of the waveguide and the waveguided beam is no longer accompanied by spurious reflected or transmitted beams. The field distribution in the waveguide channel has been calculated numerically. The calculated transmission and far-field intensity pattern are in good agreement with the experimental results. © 2005 The American Physical Society.},
