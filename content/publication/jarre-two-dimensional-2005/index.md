abstract: A two-dimensionally confining x-ray channel waveguide structure is combined
  with a high gain Kirkpatrick-Baez prefocusing mirror system yielding a hard x-ray
  beam with a cross section of 25 × 47 nm2 (FWHM). Unlike the previously employed
  resonant beam coupling scheme, the incoming beam is coupled in from the front side
  of the waveguide and the waveguided beam is no longer accompanied by spurious reflected
  or transmitted beams. The field distribution in the waveguide channel has been calculated
  numerically. The calculated transmission and far-field intensity pattern are in
  good agreement with the experimental results. © 2005 The American Physical Society.
