abstract: Quantum manipulation of populations and pathways in matter by light pulses,
  so-called coherent control, is currently one of the hottest research areas in optical
  physics and photochemistry. The forefront of coherent control research is moving
  rapidly into the regime of extreme ultraviolet wavelength and attosecond temporal
  resolution. This advance has been enabled by the development of high harmonic generation
  light sources driven by intense femtosecond laser pulses and by the advent of seeded
  free electron laser sources. Synchrotron radiation, which is usually illustrated
  as being of poor temporal coherence, hitherto has not been considered as a tool
  for coherent control. Here we show an approach based on synchrotron radiation to
  study coherent control in the extreme ultraviolet and attosecond regime. We demonstrate
  this capability by achieving wave-packet interferometry on Rydberg wave packets
  generated in helium atoms.
