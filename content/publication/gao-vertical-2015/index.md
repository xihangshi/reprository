abstract: Abstract  Transport of subwavelength electromagnetic (EM) energy has been
  achieved through near‐field coupling of highly confined surface EM modes supported
  by plasmonic nanoparticles, in a configuration usually on a two‐dimensional (2D)
  substrate. Vertical transport of similar modes along the third dimension, on the
  other hand, can bring more flexibility in designs of functional photonic devices,
  but this phenomenon has not been observed in reality. In this paper, designer (or
  spoof) surface plasmon resonators (‘plasmonic meta‐atoms’) are stacked in the direction
  vertical to their individual planes in demonstrating vertical transport of subwavelength
  localized surface EM modes. The dispersion relation of this vertical transport is
  determined from coupled‐mode theory and is verified with a near‐field transmission
  spectrum and field mapping with a microwave near‐field scanning stage. This work
  extends the near‐field coupled resonator optical waveguide (CROW) theory into the
  vertical direction, and may find applications in novel three‐dimensional slow‐light
  structures, filters, and photonic circuits.   image
