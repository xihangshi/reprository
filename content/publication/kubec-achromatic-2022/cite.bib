 abstract = {Diffractive and refractive optical elements have become an integral part of most high-resolution X-ray microscopes. However, they suffer from inherent chromatic aberration. This has to date restricted their use to narrow-bandwidth radiation, essentially limiting such high-resolution X-ray microscopes to high-brightness synchrotron sources. Similar to visible light optics, one way to tackle chromatic aberration is by combining a focusing and a defocusing optic with different dispersive powers. Here, we present the first successful experimental realisation of an X-ray achromat, consisting of a focusing diffractive Fresnel zone plate (FZP) and a defocusing refractive lens (RL). Using scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) and ptychography, we demonstrate sub-micrometre achromatic focusing over a wide energy range without any focal adjustment. This type of X-ray achromat will overcome previous limitations set by the chromatic aberration of diffractive and refractive optics and paves the way for new applications in spectroscopy and microscopy at broadband X-ray tube sources.},
