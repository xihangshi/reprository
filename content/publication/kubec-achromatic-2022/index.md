abstract: Diffractive and refractive optical elements have become an integral part
  of most high-resolution X-ray microscopes. However, they suffer from inherent chromatic
  aberration. This has to date restricted their use to narrow-bandwidth radiation,
  essentially limiting such high-resolution X-ray microscopes to high-brightness synchrotron
  sources. Similar to visible light optics, one way to tackle chromatic aberration
  is by combining a focusing and a defocusing optic with different dispersive powers.
  Here, we present the first successful experimental realisation of an X-ray achromat,
  consisting of a focusing diffractive Fresnel zone plate (FZP) and a defocusing refractive
  lens (RL). Using scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) and ptychography,
  we demonstrate sub-micrometre achromatic focusing over a wide energy range without
  any focal adjustment. This type of X-ray achromat will overcome previous limitations
  set by the chromatic aberration of diffractive and refractive optics and paves the
  way for new applications in spectroscopy and microscopy at broadband X-ray tube
  sources.
