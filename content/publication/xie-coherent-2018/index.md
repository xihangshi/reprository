abstract: Epitaxy forms the basis of modern electronics and optoelectronics. We report
  coherent atomically thin superlattices in which different transition metal dichalcogenide
  monolayers—despite large lattice mismatches—are repeated and laterally integrated
  without dislocations within the monolayer plane. Grown by an omnidirectional epitaxy,
  these superlattices display fully matched lattice constants across heterointerfaces
  while maintaining an isotropic lattice structure and triangular symmetry. This strong
  epitaxial strain is precisely engineered via the nanoscale supercell dimensions,
  thereby enabling broad tuning of the optical properties and producing photoluminescence
  peak shifts as large as 250 millielectron volts. We present theoretical models to
  explain this coherent growth and the energetic interplay governing the ripple formation
  in these strained monolayers. Such coherent superlattices provide building blocks
  with targeted functionalities at the atomically thin limit.
