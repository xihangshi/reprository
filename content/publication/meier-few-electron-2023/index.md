abstract: Free electrons are essential in such diverse applications as electron microscopes,
  accelerators and photoemission spectroscopy. However, the space charge effects of
  many electrons are often a problem and, when confined to extremely small space–time
  dimensions, even two electrons can interact strongly. Here we demonstrate that the
  resulting Coulomb repulsion can be highly advantageous, as it leads to strong electron–electron
  correlations. We show that femtosecond laser-emitted electrons from nanometric needle
  tips are highly anticorrelated in terms of energy because of dynamic Coulomb repulsion,
  with a visibility of 56%. We extract a mean energy splitting of 3.3 eV and a correlation
  decay time of 82 fs. The energy-filtered electrons display a sub-Poissonian number
  distribution with a second-order correlation function as small as g(2) = 0.34, implying
  that shot-noise-reduced pulsed electron beams can be realized by simple energy filtering.
  We also reach the strong-field regime of laser-driven electron emission and gain
  insights into how the electron correlations of the different electron classes (direct
  or rescattered) are influenced by the strong laser fields.
