abstract: Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a vapor phase technique capable of producing
  thin films of a variety of materials. Based on sequential, self-limiting reactions,
  ALD offers exceptional conformality on high-aspect ratio structures, thickness control
  at the Angstrom level, and tunable film composition. With these advantages, ALD
  has emerged as a powerful tool for many industrial and research applications. In
  this review, we provide a brief introduction to ALD and highlight select applications,
  including Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cell devices, high-k transistors, and solid oxide fuel
  cells these examples are chosen to illustrate the variety of technologies that are
  impacted by ALD, the range of materials that ALD can deposit - from metal oxides
  such as Zn1-xSnxOy, ZrO 2, Y2O3, to noble metals such as Pt - and the way in which
  the unique features of ALD can enable new levels of performance and deeper fundamental
  understanding to be achieved. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
