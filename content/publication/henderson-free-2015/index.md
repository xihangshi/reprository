abstract: Several methods have been proposed in the literature to improve free electron
  laser output by transforming the electron phase-space before entering the FEL interaction
  region. By utilizing ‘beam by design’ with novel undulators and other beam changing
  elements, the operating capability of FELs may be further usefully extended. This
  paper introduces two new such methods to improve output from electron pulses with
  large energy spreads and the results of simulations of these methods in the 1D limit
  are presented. Both methods predict orders of magnitude improvements to output radiation
  powers.
