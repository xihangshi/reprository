abstract: A method of fabricating multilayer focusing mirrors that can focus X-rays
  down to 10 nm or less was established in this study. The wavefront aberration induced
  by multilayer Kirkpatrick–Baez mirror optics was measured using a single grating
  interferometer at a photon energy of 9.1 keV at SPring-8 Angstrom Compact Free Electron
  Laser (SACLA), and the mirror shape was then directly corrected by employing a differential
  deposition method. The accuracies of these processes were carefully investigated,
  considering the accuracy required for diffraction-limited focusing. The wavefront
  produced by the corrected multilayer focusing mirrors was characterized again in
  the same manner, revealing that the root mean square of the wavefront aberration
  was improved from 2.7 (3.3) rad to 0.52 (0.82) rad in the vertical (horizontal)
  direction. A wave-optical simulator indicated that these wavefront-corrected multilayer
  focusing mirrors are capable of achieving sub-10-nm X-ray focusing.
