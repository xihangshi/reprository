 abstract = {In coherent diffraction experiments, knowledge of the incident field is important to extract pure sample-induced data from measured diffraction patterns. However, this becomes challenging in x-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs), as incident fields vary from pulse to pulse due to the stochastic nature of self-amplified stimulated emission. Despite various proposed field retrieval methods, single-shot characterization of each pulse remains elusive. To address this, we propose the speckle-correlation scattering matrix as a solution. Our method directly reconstructs the complex field without sample constraints or multiple acquisitions by introducing a designed diffuser before the detector. We demonstrate the robustness of our approach through successful field reconstructions in various experimental configurations. Based on the retrieved field results, pulse-to-pulse variations in pulse intensity, position, illumination angle, and shape were analyzed. We believe our method can readily serve as an on-field and real-time pulse diagnostic tool at XFELs and improve the overall quality of all experiments performed at XFELs.},
