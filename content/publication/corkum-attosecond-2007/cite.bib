 abstract = {The motion of electrons on the atomic scale has been hidden from direct experimental access until recently. We review the revolution in technology that opened the door to real-time observation and time-domain control of atomic-scale electron dynamics, and address the expected implications of having the tools to monitor electrons with sub-atomic resolution in both space and time.
