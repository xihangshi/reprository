abstract: The motion of electrons on the atomic scale has been hidden from direct
  experimental access until recently. We review the revolution in technology that
  opened the door to real-time observation and time-domain control of atomic-scale
  electron dynamics, and address the expected implications of having the tools to
  monitor electrons with sub-atomic resolution in both space and time. Â©2007 Nature
