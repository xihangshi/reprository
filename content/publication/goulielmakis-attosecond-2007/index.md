abstract: 'Electrons emit light, carry electric current, and bind atoms together to
  form molecules. Insight into and control of their atomic-scale motion are the key
  to understanding the functioning of biological systems, developing efficient sources
  of x-ray light, and speeding up electronics. Capturing and steering this electron
  motion require attosecond resolution and control, respectively (1 attosecond = 10?18
  seconds). A recent revolution in technology has afforded these capabilities: Controlled
  light waves can steer electrons inside and around atoms, marking the birth of lightwave
  electronics. Isolated attosecond pulses, well reproduced and fully characterized,
  demonstrate the power of the new technology. Controlled few-cycle light waves and
  synchronized attosecond pulses constitute its key tools. We review the current state
  of lightwave electronics and highlight some future directions.'
