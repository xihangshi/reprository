abstract: Molybdenum disulphide is a layered transition metal dichalcogenide that
  has recently raised considerable interest due to its unique semiconducting and opto-electronic
  properties. Although several theoretical studies have suggested an electronic phase
  transition in molybdenum disulphide, there has been a lack of experimental evidence.
  Here we report comprehensive studies on the pressure-dependent electronic, vibrational,
  optical and structural properties of multilayered molybdenum disulphide up to 35â
  €‰GPa. Our experimental results reveal a structural lattice distortion followed
  by an electronic transition from a semiconducting to metallic state at ∼19â €‰GPa,
  which is confirmed by ab initio calculations. The metallization arises from the
  overlap of the valance and conduction bands owing to sulphur-sulphur interactions
  as the interlayer spacing reduces. The electronic transition affords modulation
  of the opto-electronic gain in molybdenum disulphide. This pressure-tuned behaviour
  can enable the development of novel devices with multiple phenomena involving the
  strong coupling of the mechanical, electrical and optical properties of layered
  nanomaterials. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.
