abstract: The radiation produced by uniformly moving sources (the Vavilov-Cherenkov
  effect, the transition radiation, and some other phenomena) is discussed. This area
  of physical research originated in the Lebedev Physical Institute of the Russian
  Academy of Sciences and now represents an integral part of modern physics.
