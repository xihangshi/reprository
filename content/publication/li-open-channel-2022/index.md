abstract: Although tremendous advances have been made in preparing porous crystals
  from molecular precursors1,2, there are no general ways of designing and making
  topologically diversified porous colloidal crystals over the 10–1,000 nm length
  scale. Control over porosity in this size range would enable the tailoring of molecular
  absorption and storage, separation, chemical sensing, catalytic and optical properties
  of such materials. Here, a universal approach for synthesizing metallic open-channel
  superlattices with pores of 10 to 1,000 nm from DNA-modified hollow colloidal nanoparticles
  (NPs) is reported. By tuning hollow NP geometry and DNA design, one can adjust crystal
  pore geometry (pore size and shape) and channel topology (the way in which pores
  are interconnected). The assembly of hollow NPs is driven by edge-to-edge rather
  than face-to-face DNA–DNA interactions. Two new design rules describing this assembly
  regime emerge from these studies and are then used to synthesize 12 open-channel
  superlattices with control over crystal symmetry, channel geometry and topology.
  The open channels can be selectively occupied by guests of the appropriate size
  and that are modified with complementary DNA (for example, Au NPs).
