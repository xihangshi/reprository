abstract: Epitaxial heterostructures based on oxide perovskites and III–V, II–VI and
  transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors form the foundation of modern electronics
  and optoelectronics1–7. Halide perovskites—an emerging family of tunable semiconductors
  with desirable properties—are attractive for applications such as solution-processed
  solar cells, light-emitting diodes, detectors and lasers8–15. Their inherently soft
  crystal lattice allows greater tolerance to lattice mismatch, making them promising
  for heterostructure formation and semiconductor integration16,17. Atomically sharp
  epitaxial interfaces are necessary to improve performance and for device miniaturization. However,
  epitaxial growth of atomically sharp heterostructures of halide perovskites has
  not yet been achieved, owing to their high intrinsic ion mobility, which leads to
  interdiffusion and large junction widths18–21, and owing to their poor chemical
  stability, which leads to decomposition of prior layers during the fabrication of
  subsequent layers. Therefore, understanding the origins of this instability and
  identifying effective approaches to suppress ion diffusion are of great importance22–26.
  Here we report an effective strategy to substantially inhibit in-plane ion diffusion
  in two-dimensional halide perovskites by incorporating rigid π-conjugated organic
  ligands. We demonstrate highly stable and tunable lateral epitaxial heterostructures,
  multiheterostructures and superlattices. Near-atomically sharp interfaces and epitaxial
  growth are revealed by low-dose aberration-corrected high-resolution transmission
  electron microscopy. Molecular dynamics simulations confirm the reduced heterostructure
  disorder and larger vacancy formation energies of the two-dimensional perovskites
  in the presence of conjugated ligands. These findings provide insights into the
  immobilization and stabilization of halide perovskite semiconductors and demonstrate
  a materials platform for complex and molecularly thin superlattices, devices and
  integrated circuits.
