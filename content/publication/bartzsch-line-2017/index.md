abstract: Currently hard coherent x-ray radiation at high photon fluxes can only be
  produced with large and expensive radiation sources, such as 3 generation synchrotrons.
  Especially in medicine, this limitation prevents various promising developments
  in imaging and therapy from being translated into clinical practice. Here we present
  a new concept of highly brilliant x-ray sources, line focus x-ray tubes (LFXTs),
  which may serve as a powerful and cheap alternative to synchrotrons and a range
  of other existing technologies. LFXTs employ an extremely thin focal spot and a
  rapidly rotating target for the electron beam which causes a change in the physical
  mechanism of target heating, allowing higher electron beam intensities at the focal
  spot. Monte Carlo simulations and numeric solutions of the heat equation are used
  to predict the characteristics of the LFXT. In terms of photon flux and coherence
  length, the performance of the line focus x-ray tube compares with inverse Compton
  scattering sources. Dose rates of up to 180 Gy can be reached in 50 cm distance
  from the focal spot. The results demonstrate that the line focus tube can serve
  as a powerful compact source for phase contrast imaging and microbeam radiation
  therapy. The production of a prototype seems technically feasible.
