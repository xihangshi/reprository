abstract: Dielectric microstructures have generated much interest in recent years
  as a means of accelerating charged particles when powered by solid state lasers.
  The acceleration gradient (or particle energy gain per unit length) is an important
  figure of merit. To design structures with high acceleration gradients, we explore
  the adjoint variable method, a highly efficient technique used to compute the sensitivity
  of an objective with respect to a large number of parameters. With this formalism,
  the sensitivity of the acceleration gradient of a dielectric structure with respect
  to its entire spatial permittivity distribution is calculated by the use of only
  two full-field electromagnetic simulations, the original and &#x02018;adjoint&#x02019;.
  The adjoint simulation corresponds physically to the reciprocal situation of a point
  charge moving through the accelerator gap and radiating. Using this formalism, we
  perform numerical optimizations aimed at maximizing acceleration gradients, which
  generate fabricable structures of greatly improved performance in comparison to
  previously examined geometries.
