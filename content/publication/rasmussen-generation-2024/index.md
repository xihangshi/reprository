abstract: Entangled photons are a key resource in quantum technologies. While intense
  laser light propagating in nonlinear crystals is conventionally used to generate
  entangled photons, such schemes have low efficiency due to the weak nonlinear response
  of known materials and losses associated with in/out photon coupling. Here, we show
  how to generate entangled polariton pairs directly within optical waveguides using
  free electrons. The measured energy loss of undeflected electrons heralds the production
  of counter-propagating polariton pairs entangled in energy and emission direction.
  For illustration, we study the excitation of plasmon polaritons in metal strip waveguides
  that strongly enhance light-matter interactions, rendering two-plasmon generation
  dominant over single-plasmon excitation. We demonstrate that electron energy losses
  detected within optimal frequency ranges can reliably signal the generation of plasmon
  pairs entangled in energy and momentum. Our proposed scheme is directly applicable
  to other types of optical waveguides for in situ generation of entangled photon
  pairs. Free electrons produce entangled polaritons with high efficiency.
