abstract: First results on the experimental realisation of a 2 × 2 programmable phase
  plate for electrons are presented. The design consists of an array of electrostatic
  elements that influence the phase of electron waves passing through 4 separately
  controllable aperture holes. This functionality is demonstrated in a conventional
  transmission electron microscope operating at 300 kV and results are in very close
  agreement with theoretical predictions. The dynamic creation of a set of electron
  probes with different phase symmetry is demonstrated, thereby bringing adaptive
  optics in TEM one step closer to reality. The limitations of the current design
  and how to overcome these in the future are discussed. Simulations show how further
  evolved versions of the current proof of concept might open new and exciting application
  prospects for beam shaping and aberration correction.
