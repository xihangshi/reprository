 abstract = {First results on the experimental realisation of a 2 × 2 programmable phase plate for electrons are presented. The design consists of an array of electrostatic elements that influence the phase of electron waves passing through 4 separately controllable aperture holes. This functionality is demonstrated in a conventional transmission electron microscope operating at 300 kV and results are in very close agreement with theoretical predictions. The dynamic creation of a set of electron probes with different phase symmetry is demonstrated, thereby bringing adaptive optics in TEM one step closer to reality. The limitations of the current design and how to overcome these in the future are discussed. Simulations show how further evolved versions of the current proof of concept might open new and exciting application prospects for beam shaping and aberration correction.},
