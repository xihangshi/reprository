abstract: Ensembles of identical atoms exhibit peculiar collective properties in their
  interaction with radiation depending on geometry and environment where they are
  embedded in. A remarkably clean and versatile platform to study collective effects
  in resonant light scattering are Mössbauer nuclei placed in planar x-ray waveguides.
  Here we conceive and demonstrate experimentally distinct temporal emission characteristics
  in these systems, ranging from a tunable accelerated exponential decay all the way
  to a pronounced oscillatory emission pattern, depending on the waveguide geometry
  and mode of excitation. The observed temporal and spatial emission characteristics
  of the collectively excited nuclear state in the waveguide -- the nuclear exciton
  -- are well reproduced by a unified theoretical model. Our findings pave the way
  for applications ranging from fundamental studies of cooperative emission at hard
  x-ray frequencies up to new methods of narrowband x-ray control via the engineering
  of collective radiation patterns.
