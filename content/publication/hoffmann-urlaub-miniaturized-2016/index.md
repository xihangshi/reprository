abstract: This paper reports on the fabrication and characterization of X-ray waveguide
  beamsplitters. The waveguide channels were manufactured by electron-beam lithography,
  reactive ion etching and wafer bonding techniques, with an empty (air) channel forming
  the guiding layer and silicon the cladding material. A focused synchrotron beam
  is efficiently coupled into the input channel. The beam is guided and split into
  two channels with a controlled (and tunable) distance at the exit of the waveguide
  chip. After free-space propagation and diffraction broadening, the two beams interfere
  and form a double-slit interference pattern in the far-field. From the recorded
  far-field, the near-field was reconstructed by a phase retrieval algorithm (error
  reduction), which was found to be extremely reliable for the two-channel setting.
  By numerical propagation methods, the reconstructed field was then propagated along
  the optical axis, to investigate the formation of the interference pattern from
  the two overlapping beams. Interestingly, phase vortices were observed and analysed.
