abstract: The paper presents a quantum mechanical treatment for analyzing the Smith–Purcell
  radiation generated by charged particles passing over a periodic conducting structure.
  In our theoretical model, the electrons interact with a surface harmonic wave excited
  near the diffraction grating when the electron velocity is almost equal to the phase
  velocity of the surface wave. Then, the surface harmonic wave is electromagnetically
  coupled to a radiation mode. The dynamics of electrons are analyzed quantum mechanically
  where the electron is represented as a traveling electron wave with a finite spreading
  length. The conversion of the surface wave into a propagating mode is analyzed using
  the classical Maxwell׳s equations. In the small-signal gain regime, closed-form
  expressions for the contributions of the stimulated and spontaneous emissions to
  the evolution of the surface wave are derived. The inclusion of the spreading length
  of the electron wave to the emission spectral line is investigated. Finally, we
  compare our results based on the quantum mechanical description of electron and
  those based on the classical approach where a good agreement is confirmed.
