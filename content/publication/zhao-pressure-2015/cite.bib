 abstract = {Layered transition-metal dichalcogenides have emerged as exciting material systems with atomically thin geometries and unique electronic properties. Pressure is a powerful tool for continuously tuning their crystal and electronic structures away from the pristine states. Here, we systematically investigated the pressurized behavior of MoSe\textlessinf\textgreater2\textless/inf\textgreater up to âˆ¼60 GPa using multiple experimental techniques and ab-initio calculations. MoSe\textlessinf\textgreater2\textless/inf\textgreater evolves from an anisotropic two-dimensional layered network to a three-dimensional structure without a structural transition, which is a complete contrast to MoS\textlessinf\textgreater2\textless/inf\textgreater. The role of the chalcogenide anions in stabilizing different layered patterns is underscored by our layer sliding calculations. MoSe\textlessinf\textgreater2\textless/inf\textgreater possesses highly tunable transport properties under pressure, determined by the gradual narrowing of its band-gap followed by metallization. The continuous tuning of its electronic structure and band-gap in the range of visible light to infrared suggest possible energy-variable optoelectronics applications in pressurized transition-metal dichalcogenides.},
