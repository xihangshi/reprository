abstract: Layered transition-metal dichalcogenides have emerged as exciting material
  systems with atomically thin geometries and unique electronic properties. Pressure
  is a powerful tool for continuously tuning their crystal and electronic structures
  away from the pristine states. Here, we systematically investigated the pressurized
  behavior of MoSetextlessinftextgreater2textless/inftextgreater up to âˆ¼60 GPa using
  multiple experimental techniques and ab-initio calculations. MoSetextlessinftextgreater2textless/inftextgreater
  evolves from an anisotropic two-dimensional layered network to a three-dimensional
  structure without a structural transition, which is a complete contrast to MoStextlessinftextgreater2textless/inftextgreater.
  The role of the chalcogenide anions in stabilizing different layered patterns is
  underscored by our layer sliding calculations. MoSetextlessinftextgreater2textless/inftextgreater
  possesses highly tunable transport properties under pressure, determined by the
  gradual narrowing of its band-gap followed by metallization. The continuous tuning
  of its electronic structure and band-gap in the range of visible light to infrared
  suggest possible energy-variable optoelectronics applications in pressurized transition-metal
  dichalcogenides.
