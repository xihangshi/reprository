abstract: A rigorous solution is obtained for the problem of radiation from an electric
  point charge that moves, at a constant speed, parallel to an electrically perfectly
  conducting grating. The relevant vectorial electromagnetic problem is reduced to
  two two-dimensional scalar ones. A Green’s-function formulation of the two problems
  is employed. For both cases, an integral equation of the second kind for the remaining
  unknown function is derived. This integral equation is solved numerically by a method
  of moments. Some numerical results for the radiation from a moving point charge
  above a sinusoidal grating are presented; in particular, the power losses of the
  point charge have been estimated.
