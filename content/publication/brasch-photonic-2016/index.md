abstract: Optical solitons are propagating pulses of light that retain their shape
  because nonlinearity and dispersion balance each other. In the presence of higher-order
  dispersion, optical solitons can emit dispersive waves via the process of soliton
  Cherenkov radiation. This process underlies supercontinuum generation and is of
  critical importance in frequency metrology. Using a continuous wave-pumped, dispersion-engineered,
  integrated silicon nitride microresonator, we generated continuously circulating
  temporal dissipative Kerr solitons.The presence of higher-order dispersion led to
  the emission of red-shifted soliton Cherenkov radiation.The output corresponds to
  a fully coherent optical frequency comb that spans two-thirds of an octave and whose
  phasewewere able to stabilize to the sub-Hertz level. By preserving coherence over
  a broad spectral bandwidth, our device offers the opportunity to develop compact
  on-chip frequency combs for frequency metrology or spectroscopy.
