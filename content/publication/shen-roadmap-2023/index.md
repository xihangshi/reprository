abstract: Abstract Spatiotemporal sculpturing of light pulse with ultimately sophisticated
  structures represents a major goal of the everlasting pursue of ultra-fast information
  transmission and processing as well as ultra-intense energy concentration and extraction.
  It also holds the key to unlock new extraordinary fundamental physical effects.
  Traditionally, spatiotemporal light pulses are always treated as spatiotemporally
  separable wave packet as solution of the Maxwell’s equations. In the past decade,
  however, more generalized forms of spatiotemporally nonseparable solution started
  to emerge with growing importance for their striking physical effects. This roadmap
  intends to highlight the recent advances in the creation and control of increasingly
  complex spatiotemporally sculptured pulses, from spatiotemporally separable to complex
  nonseparable states, with diverse geometric and topological structures, presenting
  a bird’s eye viewpoint on the zoology of spatiotemporal light fields and the outlook
  of future trends and open challenges.
