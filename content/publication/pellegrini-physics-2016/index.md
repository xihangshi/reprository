abstract: X-ray free-electron lasers (x-ray FELs) give us for the first time the possibility
  to explore structures and dynamical processes of atomic and molecular systems at
  the angstrom-femtosecond space and time scales. They generate coherent photon pulses
  with time duration of a few to 100 fs, peak power of 10 to 100 GW, over a wavelength
  range extending from about 100 nm to less than 1 Ã…. Using these novel and unique
  capabilities new scientific results are being obtained in atomic and molecular sciences,
  in areas of physics, chemistry, and biology. This paper reviews the physical principles,
  the theoretical models, and the numerical codes on which x-ray FELs are based, starting
  from a single electron spontaneous undulator radiation to the FEL collective instability
  of a high density electron beam, strongly enhancing the electromagnetic radiation
  field intensity and its coherence properties. A short review is presented of the
  main experimental properties of x-ray FELs, and the results are discussed of the
  most recent research to improve their longitudinal coherence properties, increase
  the peak power, and generate multicolor spectra.
