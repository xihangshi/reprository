abstract: We report on the development of an ultrafast Transmission Electron Microscope
  based on a cold field emission source which can operate in either DC or ultrafast
  mode. Electron emission from a tungsten nanotip is triggered by femtosecond laser
  pulses which are tightly focused by optical components integrated inside a cold
  field emission source close to the cathode. The properties of the electron probe
  (brightness, angular current density, stability) are quantitatively determined.
  The measured brightness is the largest reported so far for UTEMs. Examples of imaging,
  diffraction and spectroscopy using ultrashort electron pulses are given. Finally,
  the potential of this instrument is illustrated by performing electron holography
  in the off-axis configuration using ultrashort electron pulses.
