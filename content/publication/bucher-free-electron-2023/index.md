abstract: The complex range of interactions between electrons and electromagnetic
  fields gave rise to countless scientific and technological advances. A prime example
  is photon-induced nearfield electron microscopy (PINEM), enabling the detection
  of confined electric fields in illuminated nanostructures with unprecedented spatial
  resolution. However, PINEM is limited by its dependence on strong fields, making
  it unsuitable for sensitive samples, and its inability to resolve complex phasor
  information. Here, we leverage the nonlinear, overconstrained nature of PINEM to
  present an algorithmic microscopy approach, achieving far superior nearfield imaging
  capabilities. Our algorithm relies on free-electron Ramsey-type interferometry to
  produce orders-of-magnitude improvement in sensitivity and ambiguity-immune nearfield
  phase reconstruction, both of which are optimal when the electron exhibits a fully
  quantum behavior. Our results demonstrate the potential of combining algorithmic
  approaches with state-of-the-art modalities in electron microscopy and may lead
  to various applications from imaging sensitive biological samples to performing
  full-field tomography of confined light. ,  Free-electron Ramsey interferometry
  enhances microscopy for superior sensitivity and ambiguity-immune phase reconstruction.
