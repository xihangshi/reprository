abstract: Engineered heterostructures consisting of thin, weakly bound layers can
  exhibit many attractive electronic properties. Dai et al. (p. 1125) used infrared
  nanoimaging on the surface of hexagonal boron nitride crystals to detect phonon
  polaritons, collective modes that originate in the coupling of photons to optical
  phonons. The findings reveal the dependence of the polariton wavelength and dispersion
  on the thickness of the material down to just a few atomic layers. Infrared nanoimaging
  is used to detect a type of surface collective mode in a representative van der
  Waals crystal. van der Waals heterostructures assembled from atomically thin crystalline
  layers of diverse two-dimensional solids are emerging as a new paradigm in the physics
  of materials. We used infrared nanoimaging to study the properties of surface phonon
  polaritons in a representative van der Waals crystal, hexagonal boron nitride. We
  launched, detected, and imaged the polaritonic waves in real space and altered their
  wavelength by varying the number of crystal layers in our specimens. The measured
  dispersion of polaritonic waves was shown to be governed by the crystal thickness
  according to a scaling law that persists down to a few atomic layers. Our results
  are likely to hold true in other polar van der Waals crystals and may lead to new
  functionalities.
