abstract: 'Following optical excitations’ life span from creation to decay into photons
  is crucial in understanding materials photophysics. Macroscopically, this is studied
  using optical techniques, such as photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy. However,
  excitation and emission pathways can vary at nanometer scales, preventing direct
  access, as no characterization technique has the relevant spatial, spectral, and
  time resolution. Here, using combined electron spectroscopies, we explore excitations’
  creation and decay in two representative optical materials: plasmonic nanoparticles
  and luminescent two-dimensional layers. The analysis of the energy lost by an exciting
  electron that is coincident in time with a visible-ultraviolet photon unveils the
  decay pathways from excitation toward light emission. This is demonstrated for phase-locked
  (coherent) interactions (localized surface plasmons) and non–phase-locked ones (point
  defect excited states). The developed cathodoluminescence excitation spectroscopy
  images energy transfer pathways at the nanometer scale, widening the available toolset
  to explore nanoscale materials. , Nanosecond temporal electron-based nano-optical
  coincidence techniques reveals energy transfer pathways'
