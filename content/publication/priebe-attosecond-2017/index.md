abstract: Ultrafast electron and X-ray imaging and spectroscopy are the basis for
  an ongoing revolution in the understanding of dynamical atomic-scale processes in
  matter. The underlying technology relies heavily on laser science for the generation
  and characterization of ever shorter pulses. Recent findings suggest that ultrafast
  electron microscopy with attosecond-structured wavefunctions may be feasible. However,
  such future technologies call for means to both prepare and fully analyse the corresponding
  free-electron quantum states. Here, we introduce a framework for the preparation,
  coherent manipulation and characterization of free-electron quantum states, experimentally
  demonstrating attosecond electron pulse trains. Phase-locked optical fields coherently
  control the electron wavefunction along the beam direction. We establish a new variant
  of quantum state tomography-'SQUIRRELS'-for free-electron ensembles. The ability
  to tailor and quantitatively map electron quantum states will promote the nanoscale
  study of electron-matter entanglement and new forms of ultrafast electron microscopy
  down to the attosecond regime.
