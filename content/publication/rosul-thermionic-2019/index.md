abstract: Solid-state thermionic devices based on van der Waals structures were proposed
  for nanoscale thermal to electrical energy conversion and integrated electronic
  cooling applications. We study thermionic cooling across gold-graphene-WSe2-graphene-gold
  structures computationally and experimentally. Graphene and WSe2 layers were stacked,
  followed by deposition of gold contacts. The I-V curve of the structure suggests
  near-ohmic contact. A hybrid technique that combines thermoreflectance and cooling
  curve measurements is used to extract the device ZT. The measured Seebeck coefficient,
  thermal and electrical conductance, and ZT values at room temperatures are in agreement
  with the theoretical predictions using first-principles calculations combined with
  real-space Greenâ€™s function formalism. This work lays the foundation for development
  of efficient thermionic devices.
