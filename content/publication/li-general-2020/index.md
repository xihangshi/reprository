abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) have attracted considerable
  interest1–4. However, most vdWHs reported so far are created by an arduous micromechanical
  exfoliation and manual restacking process5, which—although versatile for proof-of-concept
  demonstrations6–16 and fundamental studies17–30—is clearly not scalable for practical
  technologies. Here we report a general synthetic strategy for two-dimensional vdWH
  arrays between metallic transition-metal dichalcogenides (m-TMDs) and semiconducting
  TMDs (s-TMDs). By selectively patterning nucleation sites on monolayer or bilayer
  s-TMDs, we precisely control the nucleation and growth of diverse m-TMDs with designable
  periodic arrangements and tunable lateral dimensions at the predesignated spatial
  locations, producing a series of vdWH arrays, including VSe2/WSe2, NiTe2/WSe2, CoTe2/WSe2,
  NbTe2/WSe2, VS2/WSe2, VSe2/MoS2 and VSe2/WS2. Systematic scanning transmission electron
  microscopy studies reveal nearly ideal vdW interfaces with widely tunable moiré
  superlattices. With the atomically clean vdW interface, we further show that the
  m-TMDs function as highly reliable synthetic vdW contacts for the underlying WSe2
  with excellent device performance and yield, delivering a high ON-current density
  of up to 900 microamperes per micrometre in bilayer WSe2 transistors. This general
  synthesis of diverse two-dimensional vdWH arrays provides a versatile material platform
  for exploring exotic physics and promises a scalable pathway to high-performance
  devices.
