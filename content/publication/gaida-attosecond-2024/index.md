abstract: Abstract Time-resolved electron microscopy aims to track nanoscale excitations
  and dynamic states of matter at a temporal resolution ultimately reaching the attosecond
  regime. Periodically time-varying fields in an illuminated specimen cause free-electron
  inelastic scattering, which enables the spectroscopic imaging of near-field intensities.
  However, access to the evolution of nanoscale fields and structures within the cycle
  of light requires sensitivity to the optical phase. Here we introduce free-electron
  homodyne detection as a universally applicable approach to electron microscopy of
  phase-resolved optical responses at high spatiotemporal resolution. In this scheme,
  a phase-controlled reference interaction serves as the local oscillator to extract
  arbitrary sample-induced modulations of a free-electron wavefunction. We demonstrate
  this principle through the phase-resolved imaging of plasmonic fields with few-nanometre
  spatial and sub-cycle temporal resolutions. Due to its sensitivity to both phase-
  and amplitude-modulated electron beams, free-electron homodyne detection measurements
  will be able to detect and amplify weak signals stemming from a wide variety of
  microscopic origins, including linear and nonlinear optical polarizations, atomic
  and molecular resonances, and attosecond-modulated structure factors.
