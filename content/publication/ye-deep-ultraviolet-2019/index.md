abstract: Smith–Purcell radiation (SPR) is electromagnetic radiation generated by
  free electrons passing over a periodic grating. Here, having the electron beam pass
  through 30 nm wide slots in an Al grating greatly shortens the SPR wavelength, and
  a directional, ultra-broadband, tunable light source spanning λ0≈230–1100  nm is
  demonstrated. By adjusting the electron energy, backward SPR can be tuned over λ0=251–340  nm.
  This work greatly extends the wavelength of SPR from the previously reported 320 nm
  to 230 nm, and provides a means of realizing an integrated free-electron broadband
  light source covering the deep ultraviolet.
