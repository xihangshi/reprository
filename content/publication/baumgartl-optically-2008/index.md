abstract: The Airy wavepacket solution for a free particle exhibits propagation invariance
  and, surprisingly, acceleration transverse to the propagation direction. Discovered
  as a solution of the free-particle Schrödinger equation, Airy wavepackets have been
  predicted, and in a recent major step forward, realized in the optical domain, but
  have never been used in any application. In this Letter we demonstrate the first
  use of the Airy light beam in optical micromanipulation. Based on the characteristic
  intensity pattern, the beam drags particles into the main intensity maximum, which
  guides particles vertically along a parabolic trajectory. This unusual property
  of Airy beams leads to a new feature in optical micromanipulation - the removal
  of particles and cells from a section of a sample chamber. We term this highly robust
  and efficient process 'optically mediated particle clearing', which enables novel
  microfluidic applications within the colloidal and biological sciences. © 2008 Macmillan
