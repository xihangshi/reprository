abstract: Kelvin predicted that the semi-angle of the V-shaped wedge behind a ship moving in deep water region
  is 19.5°, independent of the ship's velocity. The predication has been challenged
  recently that the semi-angle would transit from the Kelvin angle to the Mach angle
  as the ship's velocity increases. In this paper, we show the graphene plasmons excited
  by a swift charged particle would have the similar phenomenon. When the velocity
  of the charged particle is relatively slow, the graphene plasmons excited would
  accumulate along the caustic boundary of the graphene plasmons pattern, forming
  the plasmonic Kelvin angle. At large velocity, however, no graphene plasmons would
  accumulate along any boundary, thereby the caustics disappear and the effective
  semi-angle of the graphene plasmons approaches the Mach angle.
