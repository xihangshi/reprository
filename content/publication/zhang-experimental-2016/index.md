abstract: Wave diffraction is fundamentally difficult
  to overcome in the routing and interconnection of photonic signals. Although the
  phenomenon of reflectionless transport through sharp corners in a routing path has
  been realized in many previous demonstrations, wave diffraction does not allow them
  to transport deep-subwavelength information or sub-diffraction-limited images. Recent
  advances in E-near-zero and anisotropic E-near-infinity metamaterials have provided
  unique possibilities of achieving reflectionless diffraction-free electromagnetic
  wave routing, but their designs are fundamentally limited to narrow bandwidths,
  and they have not been demonstrated in reality. Here we experimentally demonstrate
  broadband reflectionless diffraction-free routing of electromagnetic waves through
  two right-angled sharp corners in a bent microwave rectangular waveguide. An image
  with deep-subwavelength information is transported through the bent waveguide in
  a broad bandwidth. This Rapid Communication supplements and extends the current
  studies of metamaterials with extreme permittivities and can be useful for routing
  and interconnection of subwavelength photonic information.
