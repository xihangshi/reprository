abstract: 'Carbon nanotubes can act as electron sources1 with very rigid structures2,
  making them particularly interesting for use as point electron sources in high-resolution
  electron-beam instruments. Promising results have been reported with respect to
  some important requirements for such applications: a stable emitted current3,4,5
  and a long lifetime6,7. Two parameters of an electron source affect the resolution
  of these instruments: the energy spread of the emitted electrons and a parameter
  called the reduced brightness, which depends on the angular current density and
  the virtual source size. Several authors have measured a low energy spread associated
  with electron emission3,7,8,9. Here we measure the reduced brightness, and find
  a value that is more than a factor of ten larger than provided by state-of-the-art
  electron sources in electron microscopes. In addition, we show that an individual
  multi-walled carbon nanotube emits most current into a single narrow beam. On the
  basis of these results, we expect that carbon nanotube electron sources will lead
  to a significant improvement in the performance of high-resolution electron-beam
  instruments.'
