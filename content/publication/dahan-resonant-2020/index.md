abstract: Quantum light–matter interactions of bound electron systems have been studied
  extensively. By contrast, quantum interactions of free electrons with light have
  only become accessible in recent years, following the discovery of photon-induced
  near-field electron microscopy (PINEM). So far, the fundamental free electron–light
  interaction in all PINEM experiments has remained weak due to its localized near-field
  nature, which imposes an energy–momentum mismatch between electrons and light. Here,
  we demonstrate a strong interaction between free-electron waves and light waves,
  resulting from precise energy–momentum phase-matching with the extended propagating
  light field. By exchanging hundreds of photons with the field, each electron simultaneously
  accelerates and decelerates in a coherent manner. Consequently, each electron’s
  quantum wavefunction evolves into a quantized energy comb, spanning a bandwidth
  of over 1,700 eV, requiring us to extend the PINEM theory. Our observation of coherent
  electron phase-matching with a propagating wave is a type of inverse-Cherenkov interaction
  that occurs with a quantum electron wavefunction, demonstrating how the extended
  nature of the electron wavefunction can alter stimulated electron–light interactions.
