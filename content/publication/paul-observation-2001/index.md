abstract: In principle, the temporal beating of superposed high harmonics obtained
  by focusing a femtosecond laser pulse in a gas jet can produce a train of very short
  intensity spikes, depending on the relative phases of the harmonics. We present
  a method to measure such phases through two-photon, two-color photoionization. We
  found that the harmonics are locked in phase and form a train of 250-attosecond
  pulses in the time domain. Harmonic generation may be a promising source for attosecond
  time-resolved measurements.
