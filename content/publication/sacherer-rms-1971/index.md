abstract: Envelope equations for a continuous beam with uni-form charge density and
  elliptical cross-section were first derived by Kapchinsky and Vladimirsky2(K-V).
  In fact, the K-V equations are not restricted to uniformly charged beams, but are
  equally valid for any charge dis-tribution with elliptical symmetry, provided the
  beam boundary and emittance are defined by rms (root-mean-square) values. This results
  because (i) the second moments of any particle distribution depend only on the linear
  part of the force (determined by least squares method), while (ii) this linear part
  of the force in turn depends only on the second moments of the distribu-tion. This
  is also true in practice for three-dimen-sional bunched beams with ellipsoidal symmetry,
  and allows the formulation of envelope equations that in-clude the effect of space
  charge on bunch length and
