 abstract = {Airy beams maintain their intensity profiles over a large propagation distance without substantial diffraction and exhibit lateral bending during propagation. This unique property has been exploited for the micromanipulation of particles, the generation of plasma channels and the guidance of plasmonic waves, but has not been explored for high-resolution optical microscopy. Here, we introduce a self-bending point spread function (SB-PSF) based on Airy beams for three-dimensional super-resolution fluorescence imaging. We designed a side-lobe-free SB-PSF and implemented a two-channel detection scheme to enable unambiguous three-dimensional localization of fluorescent molecules. The lack of diffraction and the propagation-dependent lateral bending make the SB-PSF well suited for precise three-dimensional localization of molecules over a large imaging depth. Using this method, we obtained super-resolution imaging with isotropic three-dimensional localization precision of 10-15 nm over a 3 μm imaging depth from ∼2,000 photons per localization. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.
