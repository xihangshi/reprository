abstract: Airy beams maintain their intensity profiles over a large propagation distance
  without substantial diffraction and exhibit lateral bending during propagation.
  This unique property has been exploited for the micromanipulation of particles,
  the generation of plasma channels and the guidance of plasmonic waves, but has not
  been explored for high-resolution optical microscopy. Here, we introduce a self-bending
  point spread function (SB-PSF) based on Airy beams for three-dimensional super-resolution
  fluorescence imaging. We designed a side-lobe-free SB-PSF and implemented a two-channel
  detection scheme to enable unambiguous three-dimensional localization of fluorescent
  molecules. The lack of diffraction and the propagation-dependent lateral bending
  make the SB-PSF well suited for precise three-dimensional localization of molecules
  over a large imaging depth. Using this method, we obtained super-resolution imaging
  with isotropic three-dimensional localization precision of 10-15 nm over a 3 μm
  imaging depth from ∼2,000 photons per localization. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers
