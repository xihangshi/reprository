abstract: The short de Broglie wavelength and strong interaction empower free electrons
  to probe scattering and excitations in materials and resolve the structure of biomolecules.
  Recent advances in using nanophotonic structures to mediate bilinear electron-photon
  interaction have brought novel optical manipulation schemes to electron beams, enabling
  high space-time-energy resolution electron microscopy, quantum-coherent optical
  modulation, attosecond metrology and pulse generation, transverse electron wavefront
  shaping, dielectric laser acceleration, and electron-photon pair generation. However,
  photonic nanostructures also exhibit nonlinearities, which have to date not been
  exploited for electron-photon interactions. Here, we report the interaction of electrons
  with spontaneously generated Kerr nonlinear optical states inside a continuous-wave
  driven photonic chip-based microresonator. Optical parametric processes give rise
  to spatiotemporal pattern formation, or dissipative structures, corresponding to
  coherent or incoherent optical frequency combs. By coupling such microcombs in situ
  to electron beams, we demonstrate that different dissipative structures induce distinct
  fingerprints in the electron spectra and Ramsey-type interference patterns. In particular,
  using spontaneously formed femtosecond temporal solitons, we achieve ultrafast temporal
  gating of the electron beam without the necessity of a pulsed laser source or a
  pulsed electron source. Our work elucidates the interaction of free electrons with
  a variety of nonlinear dissipative states, demonstrates the ability to access solitons
  inside an electron microscope, and extends the use of microcombs to unexplored territories,
  with ramifications in novel ultrafast electron microscopy, light-matter interactions
  driven by on-chip temporal solitons, and ultra-high spatiotemporal resolution sampling
  of nonlinear optical dynamics and devices.
