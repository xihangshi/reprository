abstract: Entanglement goes large  The success of quantum computing relies on the
  ability to entangle large-scale systems. Various platforms are being pursued, with
  architectures based on superconducting qubits and trapped atoms being the most advanced.
  By entangling up to 20 qubits, Omran et al. and Song et al. —working with Rydberg
  atom qubits and superconducting qubits, respectively—demonstrate how far these platforms
  have reached. The demonstrated controllable generation and detection of entanglement
  on such quantum systems is promising for the development of large-scale quantum
  processors.   Science , this issue p. 570 , p. 574  ,  Entanglement of up to 20
  qubits is achieved in superconducting and trapped atom platforms. ,  Multipartite
  entangled states are crucial for numerous applications in quantum information science.
  However, the generation and verification of multipartite entanglement on fully controllable
  and scalable quantum platforms remains an outstanding challenge. We report the deterministic
  generation of an 18-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state and multicomponent
  atomic Schrödinger cat states of up to 20 qubits on a quantum processor, which features
  20 superconducting qubits, also referred to as artificial atoms, interconnected
  by a bus resonator. By engineering a one-axis twisting Hamiltonian, the system of
  qubits, once initialized, coherently evolves to multicomponent atomic Schrödinger
  cat states—that is, superpositions of atomic coherent states including the GHZ state—at
  specific time intervals as expected. Our approach on a solid-state platform should
  not only stimulate interest in exploring the fundamental physics of quantum many-body
  systems, but also enable the development of applications in practical quantum metrology
  and quantum information processing.
