abstract: Background Metamaterials (MMs) are smartly engineered structures with rationally
  designed, nanostructured building blocks that allow us to build devices with distinct
  responses to light, acoustic waves, and heat flows that are not attainable with
  naturally available materials.   Advances The latest developments have shown that
  optical metasurfaces comprising a class of optical MMs with a reduced dimensionality
  can exhibit exceptional abilities for controlling the flow of light; achieve the
  anomalously large photonic density of states; and, similar to their bulk analog,
  provide superresolution imaging. Such a planar photonics technology is expected
  to facilitate new physics and enhanced functionality for devices that are distinctly
  different from those observed in their three-dimensional MM counterparts. As a result,
  this technology will enable new applications in imaging, sensing, data storage,
  quantum information processing, and light harvesting.   Outlook The recent progress
  in optical metasurfaces can address the major issues hampering the full-scale development
  of MM technology, such as high loss, cost-ineffective fabrication, and challenging
  integration. The studies of new, low-loss, tunable plasmonic materials—such as transparent
  conducting oxides and intermetallics—that can be used as building blocks for metasurfaces
  will complement the exploration of smart designs and advanced switching capabilities.
  This progress in metasurface design and realization will lead to novel functionalities
  and improved performance and may result in the development of new types of ultrathin
  metasurface designs with unparalleled properties, including increased operational
  bandwidths and reduced losses. These new designs would also be compatible with planar,
  low-cost manufacturing. In turn, these advances will lead to ultrathin devices with
  unprecedented functionalities, ranging from dynamic spatial light modulation to
  pulse shaping and from subwavelength imaging or sensing to novel quantum optics
  devices.  ,  A Move to Planar Optics  Metamaterials allow light to be manipulated
  in ways that cannot be done with naturally available materials. Subwavelength metallic
  nanoantenna arrays patterned onto a surface can provide the basis for planar optical
  devices, in which bulk optical elements that are typically thousands of wavelengths
  in size can be \"flattened\" into a two-dimensional sheet less than a wavelength
  thick.  Kildishev et al.  ( 10.1126/science.1232009 ) review progress in the optics
  of metasurfaces and discuss promising applications for surface-confined planar photonics
  components.  ,  Metamaterials, or engineered materials with rationally designed,
  subwavelength-scale building blocks, allow us to control the behavior of physical
  fields in optical, microwave, radio, acoustic, heat transfer, and other applications
  with flexibility and performance that are unattainable with naturally available
  materials. In turn, metasurfaces—planar, ultrathin metamaterials—extend these capabilities
  even further. Optical metasurfaces offer the fascinating possibility of controlling
  light with surface-confined, flat components. In the planar photonics concept, it
  is the reduced dimensionality of the optical metasurfaces that enables new physics
  and, therefore, leads to functionalities and applications that are distinctly different
  from those achievable with bulk, multilayer metamaterials. Here, we review the progress
  in developing optical metasurfaces that has occurred over the past few years with
  an eye toward the promising future directions in the field.
