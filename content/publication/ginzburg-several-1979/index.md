abstract: The process of transition radiation is a very general one. It appears if
  some source, which does not have a proper frequency (for example a point charge,
  multipole etc.), is moving with a constant velocity in an inhomogeneous and/or nonstationary
  medium. In the case of a periodic medium the transition radiation has some special
  peculiarities and is called the resonance transition radiation or transition scattering.
  Transition scattering occurs particularly in the case when some wave of dielectric
  permitivity acts on a nonmoving (fixed) charge. The processes of transition radiation
  and transition scattering have analogies outside electrodynamics similarly to the
  Vavilov-Cherenkov emission. The latter occurs also for a source moving with a constant
  velocity but in a homogeneous medium (and only if the velocity of the source exceeds
  the wave phase velocity in the medium). The present review is dealing with several
  problems of the theory of transition radiation and transition scattering. Attention
  is paid mainly to the formulation of the problems and to revealing characteristic
  features and peculiarities of the phenomena described.
