abstract: X-ray emission spectroscopy is emerging as an important complement to x-ray
  absorption fine structure spectroscopy, providing a characterization of the occupied
  electronic density of states local to the species of interest. Here, we present
  details of the design and performance of a compact x-ray emission spectrometer that
  uses a dispersive refocusing Rowland (DRR) circle geometry to achieve excellent
  performance for the 2-2.5 keV range, i.e., especially for the K-edge emission from
  sulfur and phosphorous. The DRR approach allows high energy resolution even for
  unfocused x-ray sources. This property enables high count rates in laboratory studies,
  approaching those of insertion-device beamlines at third-generation synchrotrons,
  despite use of only a low-powered, conventional x-ray tube. The spectrometer, whose
  overall scale is set by use of a 10-cm diameter Rowland circle and a new small-pixel
  complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor x-ray camera, is easily portable to synchrotron
  or x-ray free electron laser beamlines. Photometrics from measurements at the Advanced
  Light Source show excellent overall instrumental efficiency. In addition, the compact
  size of this instrument lends itself to future multiplexing to gain large factors
  in net collection efficiency or its implementation in controlled gas gloveboxes
  either in the lab or in an endstation.
