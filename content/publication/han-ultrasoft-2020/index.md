abstract: Continuum scaling laws often break down when materials approach atomic length
  scales, reflecting changes in their underlying physics and the opportunities to
  access unconventional properties. These continuum limits are evident in two-dimensional
  materials, where there is no consensus on their bending stiffnesses or how they
  scale with thickness. Through combined computational and electron microscopy experiments,
  we measure the bending stiffness of graphene, obtaining 1.2â€“1.7 eV for a monolayer.
  Moreover, we find that the bending stiffness of few-layer graphene decreases sharply
  as a function of bending angle, tuning by almost 400% for trilayer graphene. This
  softening results from shear, slip and the onset of superlubricity between the atomic
  layers and corresponds with a gradual change in scaling power from cubic to linear.
  Our results provide a unified model for bending in two-dimensional materials and
  show that their multilayers can be orders of magnitude softer than previously thought,
  among the most flexible electronic materials currently known.
