abstract: Free electrons act as a source of highly conﬁned, spectrally broad optical
  ﬁelds that are widely used to map photonic modes with nanometer/millielectronvolt
  space/energy resolution through currently available electron energy-loss and cathodoluminescence
  spectroscopies. These techniques are understood as probes of the linear optical
  response, while nonlinear dynamics has escaped observation with similar degree of
  spatial detail, despite the strong enhancement of the electron evanescent ﬁeld with
  decreasing electron energy. Here, we show that the ﬁeld accompanying low-energy
  electrons can trigger anharmonic response in strongly nonlinear materials. Speciﬁcally,
  through realistic quantum-mechanical simulations, we ﬁnd that the interaction between
  ≲100 eV electrons and plasmons in graphene nanostructures gives rise to substantial
  optical nonlinearities that are discernible as saturation and spectral shifts in
  the plasmonic features revealed in the cathodoluminescence emission and electron
  energy-loss spectra. Our results support the use of low-energy electron-beam spectroscopies
  for the exploration of nonlinear optical processes in nanostructures.
