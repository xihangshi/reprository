abstract: Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted lots
  of interest because of their potential for electronic and optoelectronic applications.
  Atomically thin TMD flakes were believed capable to scroll into nanoscrolls (NSs)
  with distinct properties. However, limited by mechanical strength and chemical stability,
  production of high-quality TMD NSs remains challenging. Here, we scroll chemical
  vapor deposition-grown monolayer TMD flakes into high-quality NSs in situ in 5 s
  with a nearly 100% yield by only one droplet of ethanol solution. An obvious photoluminescence
  is demonstrated in NSs and the self-encapsulated structure makes NSs more insensitive
  to external factors in optical and electrical properties. Furthermore, based on
  the internal open topology, NSs hybridized with a variety of functional materials
  have been fabricated, which is expected to confer TMD NSs with additional properties
  and functions attractive for potential application.
