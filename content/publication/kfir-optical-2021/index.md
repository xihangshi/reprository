abstract: We theoretically investigate the quantum-coherence properties of the cathodoluminescence
  (CL) emission produced by a temporally modulated electron beam. Specifically, we
  consider the quantum-optical correlations of CL produced by electrons that are previously
  shaped by a laser field. Our main prediction is the presence of phase correlations
  between the emitted CL field and the electron-modulating laser, even though the
  emission intensity and spectral profile are independent of the electron state. In
  addition, the coherence of the CL field extends to harmonics of the laser frequency.
  Since electron beams can be focused to below 1 Å, their ability to transfer optical
  coherence could enable the ultra-precise excitation, manipulation, and spectrally
  resolved probing of nanoscale quantum systems.
