abstract: This chapter discusses the radiation by uniformly moving sources. The motion
  of sources at a constant velocity is of great importance in the electrodynamics
  of continuous media, particularly in plasma. The chapter discusses the radiation
  of a source, moving uniformly in or near a medium. The quantum theory of the Vavilov-Cherenkov
  effect is considered. When a source moves uniformly and rectilinearly in a medium
  with a velocity, Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation occurs. When the medium is spatially
  homogeneous and time-independent, only the Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation is possible.
  Energy losses because of the Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation contribute to the total
  losses, called “ionization losses.” The Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation in a transparent
  medium is separated from the total losses, as it can go far from the source trajectory.
  Transition radiation is produced when a charge moves uniformly and in a straight
  line under nonuniform conditions. Transition radiation, transition scattering, and
  transition Bremsstrahlung play a particularly important role in connection with
  plasma.
