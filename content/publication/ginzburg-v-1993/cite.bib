 abstract = {This chapter discusses the radiation by uniformly moving sources. The motion of sources at a constant velocity is of great importance in the electrodynamics of continuous media, particularly in plasma. The chapter discusses the radiation of a source, moving uniformly in or near a medium. The quantum theory of the Vavilov-Cherenkov effect is considered. When a source moves uniformly and rectilinearly in a medium with a velocity, Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation occurs. When the medium is spatially homogeneous and time-independent, only the Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation is possible. Energy losses because of the Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation contribute to the total losses, called “ionization losses.” The Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation in a transparent medium is separated from the total losses, as it can go far from the source trajectory. Transition radiation is produced when a charge moves uniformly and in a straight line under nonuniform conditions. Transition radiation, transition scattering, and transition Bremsstrahlung play a particularly important role in connection with plasma.},
