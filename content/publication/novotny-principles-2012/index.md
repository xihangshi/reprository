abstract: 'First published in 2006, this book has become the standard reference on
  nano-optics. Now in its second edition, the text has been thoroughly updated to
  take into account new developments and research directions. While the overall structure
  and pedagogical style of the book remain unchanged, all existing chapters have been
  expanded and a new chapter has been added. Adopting a broad perspective, the authors
  provide a detailed overview of the theoretical and experimental concepts that are
  needed to understand and work in nano-optics, across subfields ranging from quantum
  optics to biophysics. New topics of discussion include: optical antennas; new imaging
  techniques; Fano interference and strong coupling; reciprocity; metamaterials; and
  cavity optomechanics. With numerous end-of-chapter problem sets and illustrative
  material to expand on ideas discussed in the main text, this is an ideal textbook
  for graduate students entering the field. It is also a valuable reference for researchers
  and course teachers.'
