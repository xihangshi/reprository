 abstract = {We report the observation of an extended series of integral harmonic lines in the spectrum of direct backscatter of 10.6-μm radiation incident at intensities ≳1014 W/cm2 onto planar solid targets. We have observed and spectrally resolved up to the eleventh harmonic (0.95 μm) at intensities well above the plasma continuum background.},
