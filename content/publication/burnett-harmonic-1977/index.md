abstract: We report the observation of an extended series of integral harmonic lines
  in the spectrum of direct backscatter of 10.6-μm radiation incident at intensities
  ≳1014 W/cm2 onto planar solid targets. We have observed and spectrally resolved
  up to the eleventh harmonic (0.95 μm) at intensities well above the plasma continuum
  background.
