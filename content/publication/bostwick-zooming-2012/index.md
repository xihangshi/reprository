abstract: In today's state-of-the-art ARPES, probe sizes are routinely in the range
  from tens to hundreds of microns. However, in complex materials, length scales from
  the nano- to the mesoscopic scales control and characterize electronic and other
  properties. Thus it is not possible to access relevant length scales for many complex
  engineered materials using ARPES. In the last 15 years, the focusing of the photon
  beam down to 10's of nm has been routinely accomplished in techniques such as scanning
  transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) and scanning photoemission microscopy (SPEM).
  Application of these techniques to ARPES to create a new \"nanoARPES\" (or nARPES
  for short) will for the first time allow the interplay between geometric and electronic
  structure to be probed directly in arbitrary sample geometries. Â© 2012 Copyright
