 abstract = {In today's state-of-the-art ARPES, probe sizes are routinely in the range from tens to hundreds of microns. However, in complex materials, length scales from the nano- to the mesoscopic scales control and characterize electronic and other properties. Thus it is not possible to access relevant length scales for many complex engineered materials using ARPES. In the last 15 years, the focusing of the photon beam down to 10's of nm has been routinely accomplished in techniques such as scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) and scanning photoemission microscopy (SPEM). Application of these techniques to ARPES to create a new "nanoARPES" (or nARPES for short) will for the first time allow the interplay between geometric and electronic structure to be probed directly in arbitrary sample geometries.
