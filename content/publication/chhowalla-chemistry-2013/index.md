abstract: Ultrathin two-dimensional nanosheets of layered transition metal dichalcogenides
  (TMDs) are fundamentally and technologically intriguing. In contrast to the graphene
  sheet, they are chemically versatile. Mono- or few-layered TMDs-obtained either
  through exfoliation of bulk materials or bottom-up syntheses-are direct-gap semiconductors
  whose bandgap energy, as well as carrier type (n- or p-type), varies between compounds
  depending on their composition, structure and dimensionality. In this Review, we
  describe how the tunable electronic structure of TMDs makes them attractive for
  a variety of applications. They have been investigated as chemically active electrocatalysts
  for hydrogen evolution and hydrosulfurization, as well as electrically active materials
  in opto-electronics. Their morphologies and properties are also useful for energy
  storage applications such as electrodes for Li-ion batteries and supercapacitors.
