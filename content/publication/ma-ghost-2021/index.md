abstract: 'Polaritons in anisotropic materials result in exotic optical features,
  which can provide opportunities to control light at the nanoscale1–10. So far these
  polaritons have been limited to two classes: bulk polaritons, which propagate inside
  a material, and surface polaritons, which decay exponentially away from an interface.
  Here we report a near-field observation of ghost phonon polaritons, which propagate
  with in-plane hyperbolic dispersion on the surface of a polar uniaxial crystal and,
  at the same time, exhibit oblique wavefronts in the bulk. Ghost polaritons are an
  atypical non-uniform surface wave solution of Maxwell’s equations, arising at the
  surface of uniaxial materials in which the optic axis is slanted with respect to
  the interface. They exhibit an unusual bi-state nature, being both propagating (phase-progressing)
  and evanescent (decaying) within the crystal bulk, in contrast to conventional surface
  waves that are purely evanescent away from the interface. Our real-space near-field
  imaging experiments reveal long-distance (over 20 micrometres), ray-like propagation
  of deeply subwavelength ghost polaritons across the surface, verifying long-range,
  directional and diffraction-less polariton propagation. At the same time, we show
  that control of the out-of-plane angle of the optic axis enables hyperbolic-to-elliptic
  topological transitions at fixed frequency, providing a route to tailor the band
  diagram topology of surface polariton waves. Our results demonstrate a polaritonic
  wave phenomenon with unique opportunities to tailor nanoscale light in natural anisotropic
  crystals.'
