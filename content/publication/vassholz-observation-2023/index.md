abstract: Using a waveguide as an x-ray anode, x-ray emission can be increased in
  certain directions, based on the Purcell effect. We demonstrate x-ray generation
  based on direct emission of spontaneous x-rays into waveguide modes. Photons are
  generated by electron impact onto a structured anode target, which is formed as
  an x-ray waveguide or waveguide array. Both emission of characteristic radiation
  and bremsstrahlung are affected by the changes in mode density induced by the waveguide
  structure. We investigate how the excited modal pattern depends on the positions
  of the metal atoms and the distance of the focused electron beam with respect to
  the waveguide exit side. We compare the results to synchrotron-excited fluorescence.
  We then discuss how x-ray generation in waveguides can be used to increase the brilliance
  and directional emission of tabletop x-ray sources, with a corresponding increase
  in the spatial coherence. On the basis of the Purcell effect, we lastly show that
  the gain of emission into waveguide modes is governed by the quality factor of the
  waveguide.
