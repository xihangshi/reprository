abstract: Quantum radiation reaction is the influence of multiple photon emissions
  from a charged particle on the particle's dynamics, characterized by a significant
  energy-momentum loss per emission. Here we report experimental radiation emission
  spectra from ultrarelativistic positrons in silicon in a regime where quantum radiation
  reaction effects dominate the positron's dynamics. Our analysis shows that while
  the widely used quantum approach is overall the best model, it does not completely
  describe all the data in this regime. Thus, these experimental findings may prompt
  seeking more generally valid methods to describe quantum radiation reaction. This
  experiment is a fundamental test of quantum electrodynamics in a regime where the
  dynamics of charged particles is strongly influenced not only by the external electromagnetic
  fields but also by the radiation field generated by the charges themselves and where
  each photon emission may significantly reduce the energy of the charge.
