abstract: Among many remarkable qualities of graphene, its electronic properties attract
  particular interest owing to the chiral character of the charge carriers, which
  leads to such unusual phenomena as metallic conductivity in the limit of no carriers
  and the half-integer quantum Hall effect observable even at room temperature. Because
  graphene is only one atom thick, it is also amenable to external influences, including
  mechanical deformation. The latter offers a tempting prospect of controlling graphenes
  properties by strain and, recently, several reports have examined graphene under
  uniaxial deformation. Although the strain can induce additional Raman features,
  no significant changes in graphenes band structure have been either observed or
  expected for realistic strains of up to ∼15% (refs9, 10, 11). Here we show that
  a designed strain aligned along three main crystallographic directions induces strong
  gauge fields that effectively act as a uniform magnetic field exceeding 10 T. For
  a finite doping, the quantizing field results in an insulating bulk and a pair of
  countercirculating edge states, similar to the case of a topological insulator.
  We suggest realistic ways of creating this quantum state and observing the pseudomagnetic
  quantum Hall effect. We also show that strained superlattices can be used to open
  significant energy gaps in graphenes electronic spectrum. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers
