abstract: Modulation of weak interlayer interactions between quasi-two-dimensional
  atomic planes in the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) provides avenues for
  tuning their functional properties. Here we show that above-gap optical excitation
  in the TMDCs leads to an unexpected large-amplitude, ultrafast compressive force
  between the two-dimensional layers, as probed by in situ measurements of the atomic
  layer spacing at femtosecond time resolution. We show that this compressive response
  arises from a dynamic modulation of the interlayer van der Waals interaction and
  that this represents the dominant light-induced stress at low excitation densities.
  A simple analytic model predicts the magnitude and carrier density dependence of
  the measured strains. This work establishes a new method for dynamic, nonequilibrium
  tuning of correlation-driven dispersive interactions and of the optomechanical functionality
  of TMDC quasi-two-dimensional materials.
