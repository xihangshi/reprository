 abstract = {Polarization properties of parametric X radiation (PXR) have been investigated theoretically and experimentally at the S-DALINAC. For the first time analytical expressions describing the polarization properties of PXR have been derived. PXR is - under ideal conditions - 100% linearly polarized in every single point of its angular distribution. In reality, however, multiple scattering of the electrons passing through the crystal, the emittance of the electron beam, the crystal mosaicity and the detector acceptance decrease the polarization degree. In the present experiment PXR was produced by E0 = 80.5 MeV electrons interacting with a (2 2 0) plane of a 13 μm silicon crystal and observed at an angle of about 20 ° by a CCD polarimeter. For the comparison of the experimental results with the theoretical predictions a Monte Carlo simulation taking into account the experimental conditions has been performed. The comparison shows very good agreement. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},
