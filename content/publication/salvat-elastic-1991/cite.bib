 abstract = {Elastic scattering of relativistic electrons and positrons by atoms is considered in the framework of the static field approximation. The scattering field is expressed as a sum of Yukawa terms to allow the use of various approximations. Accurate phase shifts have been computed by combining Bührings power-series method with the WKB and Born approximations. This combined procedure allows the evaluation of differential cross sections for kinetic energies up to several tens of MeV. Numerical results are used to analyze the validity of several approximate methods, namely the first- and second-order Born approximations and the screened Mott formula, which are frequently adopted as the basis of multiple scattering theories and Monte Carlo simulations of electron and positron transport. © 1991 The American Physical Society.},
