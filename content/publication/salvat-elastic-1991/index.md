abstract: Elastic scattering of relativistic electrons and positrons by atoms is considered
  in the framework of the static field approximation. The scattering field is expressed
  as a sum of Yukawa terms to allow the use of various approximations. Accurate phase
  shifts have been computed by combining Bührings power-series method with the WKB
  and Born approximations. This combined procedure allows the evaluation of differential
  cross sections for kinetic energies up to several tens of MeV. Numerical results
  are used to analyze the validity of several approximate methods, namely the first-
  and second-order Born approximations and the screened Mott formula, which are frequently
  adopted as the basis of multiple scattering theories and Monte Carlo simulations
  of electron and positron transport. © 1991 The American Physical Society.
