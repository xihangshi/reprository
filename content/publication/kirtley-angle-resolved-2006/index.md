abstract: Understanding the nature of the ground state and its low-lying excitations
  in the copper oxide superconductors is a prerequisite for determining the origin
  of high-temperature superconductivity. A superconducting order parameter (that is,
  the energy gap) with a predominantly symmetry is well-established. However, various
  deviations from a pure d-wave pair state, such as the possibility of Cooper pairing
  with broken time-reversal symmetry or an admixed +s pair state, have been theoretically
  predicted and actively sought in numerous experimental studies. Here, we present
  an angle-resolved phase-sensitive technique for accurately determining the in-plane
  pairing symmetry, and demonstrate this technique in optimally doped YBa2Cu3O7−δ.
  We find that the gap along the b-axis (Cu–O chain) direction is at least 20% larger
  than that along the a-axis direction, and that any imaginary i dx y, is or ip component
  must be smaller than a few per&nbsp;cent of the component of the gap.
