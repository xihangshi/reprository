abstract: Electrons interacting with plasmonic structures can give rise to resonant
  excitations in localized plasmonic cavities and to collective excitations in periodic
  structures. We investigate the presence of resonant features and disorder in the
  conventional Smith-Purcell effect (electrons interacting with periodic structures)
  and observe the simultaneous excitation of both the plasmonic resonances and the
  collective excitations. For this purpose, we introduce a new scanning-electron-microscope-based
  setup that allows us to probe and directly image new features of electron-photon
  interactions in nanophotonic structures like plasmonic crystals with strong disorder.
  Our work creates new possibilities for probing nanostructures with free electrons,
  with potential applications that include tunable sources of short-wavelength radiation
  and plasmonic-based particle accelerators.
