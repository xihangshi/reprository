 abstract = {We show that calculations based on the use of Bloch functions in at least two-dimensions predict both coherent brems-strahlung peaks (kCB) and channeling radiation peaks (kCR) in the spectrum of photons emitted by electrons traversing a crystal when moving nearly parallel to a crystal plane; and that furthermore, “sidebands” (e.g., kCB ± kCR) are predicted when the electrons move nearly parallel to two intersecting crystal planes.},
