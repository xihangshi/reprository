abstract: We show that calculations based on the use of Bloch functions in at least
  two-dimensions predict both coherent brems-strahlung peaks (kCB) and channeling
  radiation peaks (kCR) in the spectrum of photons emitted by electrons traversing
  a crystal when moving nearly parallel to a crystal plane; and that furthermore,
  “sidebands” (e.g., kCB ± kCR) are predicted when the electrons move nearly parallel
  to two intersecting crystal planes.
