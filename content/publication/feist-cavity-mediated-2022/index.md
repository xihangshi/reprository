abstract: Quantum information, communication, and sensing rely on the generation and
  control of quantum correlations in complementary degrees of freedom. Free electrons
  coupled to photonics promise novel hybrid quantum technologies, although single-particle
  correlations and entanglement have yet to be shown. In this work, we demonstrate
  the preparation of electron-photon pair states using the phase-matched interaction
  of free electrons with the evanescent vacuum field of a photonic chip?based optical
  microresonator. Spontaneous inelastic scattering produces intracavity photons coincident
  with energy-shifted electrons, which we employ for noise-suppressed optical mode
  imaging. This parametric pair-state preparation will underpin the future development
  of free-electron quantum optics, providing a route to quantum-enhanced imaging,
  electron-photon entanglement, and heralded single-electron and Fock-state photon
  sources. The interaction of electron beams with cavities and resonant structures
  represents a universal scheme for generating electromagnetic radiation. Feist et
  al. fabricated structures with phase-matched interactions between free electrons
  and the vacuum cavity field of a photonic chip-based microresonator. As the electrons
  passed near the resonator, coupling between them and the vacuum field resulted in
  the spontaneous generation of photons within the cavity. Because the electron-photon
  pairs are correlated, they should be a useful source for the development of free-electron
  quantum optics providing enhanced imaging and sensing capabilities. ?ISO The parametric
  generation of electron-photon pair states enables heralded single-particle sources.
