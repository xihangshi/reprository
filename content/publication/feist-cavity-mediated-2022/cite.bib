 abstract = {Quantum information, communication, and sensing rely on the generation and control of quantum correlations in complementary degrees of freedom. Free electrons coupled to photonics promise novel hybrid quantum technologies, although single-particle correlations and entanglement have yet to be shown. In this work, we demonstrate the preparation of electron-photon pair states using the phase-matched interaction of free electrons with the evanescent vacuum field of a photonic chip?based optical microresonator. Spontaneous inelastic scattering produces intracavity photons coincident with energy-shifted electrons, which we employ for noise-suppressed optical mode imaging. This parametric pair-state preparation will underpin the future development of free-electron quantum optics, providing a route to quantum-enhanced imaging, electron-photon entanglement, and heralded single-electron and Fock-state photon sources. The interaction of electron beams with cavities and resonant structures represents a universal scheme for generating electromagnetic radiation. Feist et al. fabricated structures with phase-matched interactions between free electrons and the vacuum cavity field of a photonic chip-based microresonator. As the electrons passed near the resonator, coupling between them and the vacuum field resulted in the spontaneous generation of photons within the cavity. Because the electron-photon pairs are correlated, they should be a useful source for the development of free-electron quantum optics providing enhanced imaging and sensing capabilities. ?ISO The parametric generation of electron-photon pair states enables heralded single-particle sources.},
