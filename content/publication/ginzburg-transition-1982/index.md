abstract: Transition radiation is a process of a rather general character. It occurs
  when some source, which does not have a proper frequency (for example, a charge)
  moves at a constant velocity in an inhomogeneous and (or) nonstationary medium or
  near such a medium. The simplest type of transition radiation takes place when a
  charge crosses a boundary between two media (the role of one of the media may be
  played by vacuum). In the case of periodic variation of the medium, transition radiation
  possesses some specific features (resonance transition radiation or transition scattering).
  Transition scattering occurs, in particular, when a permittivity wave falls onto
  an nonmoving (fixed) charge. Transition scattering is closely connected with transition
  bremsstrahlung radiation. All these transition processes are essential for plasma
  physics. Transition radiation and transition scattering have analogues outside the
  framework of electrodynamics (like in the case of Vavilovâ€“Cherenkov radiation).
  In the present report the corresponding range of phenomena is elucidated, as far
  as possible, in a generally physical aspect.
