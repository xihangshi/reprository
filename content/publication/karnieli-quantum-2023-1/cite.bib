 abstract = {Strong coupling in light-matter systems is a central concept in cavity quantum electrodynamics and is essential for many quantum technologies. Especially in the optical range, full control of highly connected multi-qubit systems necessitates quantum coherent probes with nanometric spatial resolution, which are currently inaccessible. Here, we propose the use of free electrons as high-resolution quantum sensors for strongly coupled light-matter systems. Shaping the free-electron wave packet enables the measurement of the quantum state of the entire hybrid systems. We specifically show how quantum interference of the free-electron wave packet gives rise to a quantum-enhanced sensing protocol for the position and dipole orientation of a subnanometer emitter inside a cavity. Our results showcase the great versatility and applicability of quantum interactions between free electrons and strongly coupled cavities, relying on the unique properties of free electrons as strongly interacting flying qubits with miniscule dimensions.

Free-electron wavefunctions can be used as probes of strong coupling and polaritonic quantum states.},
