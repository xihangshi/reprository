 abstract = {A theory for the description of the linear polarization direction (LPD) of the parametric X-ray radiation (PXR) differential yield is developed. The general expression for the LPD as well as simple formulae for the PLD and tangent curves in the vicinity of the PXR reflection are derived. Typical calculated polarization structures of the PXR reflection are demonstrated. The phases of the PXR waves with parallel and perpendicular LPDs are considered.},
