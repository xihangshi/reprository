abstract: A theory for the description of the linear polarization direction (LPD)
  of the parametric X-ray radiation (PXR) differential yield is developed. The general
  expression for the LPD as well as simple formulae for the PLD and tangent curves
  in the vicinity of the PXR reflection are derived. Typical calculated polarization
  structures of the PXR reflection are demonstrated. The phases of the PXR waves with
  parallel and perpendicular LPDs are considered.
