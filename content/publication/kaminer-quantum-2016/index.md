abstract: We show that the well-known Čerenkov effect contains new phenomena arising
  from the quantum nature of charged particles. The Čerenkov transition amplitudes
  allow coupling between the charged particle and the emitted photon through their
  orbital angular momentum and spin, by scattering into preferred angles and polarizations.
  Importantly, the spectral response reveals a discontinuity immediately below a frequency
  cutoffthat can occur in the optical region. Near this cutoff, the intensity of the
  conventional Čerenkov radiation (ČR) is very small but still finite, while our quantum
  calculation predicts exactly zero intensity above the cutoff. Below that cutoff,
  with proper shaping of electron beams (ebeams), we predict that the traditional
  ČR angle splits into two distinctive cones of photonic shockwaves. One of the shockwaves
  can move along a backward cone, otherwise considered impossible for conventional
  ČR in ordinary matter. Our findings are observable for ebeams with realistic parameters,
  offering new applications including novel quantum optics sources, and opening a
  new realm for Čerenkov detectors involving the spin and orbital angular momentum
  of charged particles.
