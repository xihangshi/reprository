abstract: The realization of the strong coupling regime between a single cavity mode
  and an electromagnetic resonance is a centrepiece of quantum optics. In this regime,
  the reversible exchange of a photon between the two components of the system leads
  to so-called Rabi oscillations. Strong coupling is used in the optical and infrared
  regimes, for instance, to produce non-classical states of light, enhance optical
  nonlinearities and control quantum states. Here, we report the first observation
  of Rabi oscillations of an X-ray photon between two resonant 57Fe layers embedded
  in two coupled cavities. The system is described by an effective Hamiltonian, in
  which the two layers couple strongly. We observe sinusoidal beating as the signature
  of the Rabi oscillations in the system’s temporal evolution, as well as the splitting
  of nuclear resonances in the reflected light spectrum. Our results significantly
  advance the development of the new field of X-ray quantum optics.
