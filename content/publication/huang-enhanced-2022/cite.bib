 abstract = {Abstract Van der Waals (vdW) materials have attracted much interest for their myriad unique electronic, mechanical, and thermal properties. In particular, they are promising candidates for monochromatic, table‐top X‐ray sources. This work reveals that the versatility of the table‐top vdW X‐ray source goes beyond what has been demonstrated so far. By introducing a tilt angle between the vdW structure and the incident electron beam, it is theoretically and experimentally shown that the accessible photon energy range is more than doubled. This allows for greater versatility in real‐time tuning of the vdW X‐ray source. Furthermore, this work shows that the accessible photon energy range is maximized by simultaneously controlling both the electron energy and the vdW structure tilt. These results will pave the way for highly tunable, compact X‐ray sources, with potential applications including hyperspectral X‐ray fluoroscopy and X‐ray quantum optics.},
