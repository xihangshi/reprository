abstract: Abstract Inline holography is a common phase-contrast imaging method which
  uses free-space propagation to encode the phase signal into measured intensities.
  However, quantitative retrieval of the sample's image remains challenging, imposing
  constraints on the nature of the sample or on the propagation distance. Here, we
  present a way of simultaneously retrieving the sample's complex-valued transmission
  function and the incident illumination function from near-field diffraction patterns.
  The procedure relies on the measurement diversity created by lateral translations
  of the sample with respect to a structured illumination. The reconstruction approach,
  in essence identical to that employed in ptychography, is applied to hard X-ray
  synchrotron measurements and to simulations. Compared to other inline holography
  techniques, we expect near-field ptychography to reduce reconstruction artefacts
  by factoring out wavefront imperfections and relaxing constraints on the sample's
  scattering properties, thus ultimately improving the robustness of propagation-based
  X-ray phase tomography.
