abstract: Active metasurfaces are emerging as the core of next-generation optical
  devices with their tunable optical responses and flat-compact topography. Especially
  for the terahertz band, active metasurfaces have been developed as fascinating devices
  for optical chopping and compressive sensing imaging. However, performance regulation
  by changing the dielectric parameters of the integrated functional materials exhibits
  severe limitations and parasitic losses. Here, we introduce a C-shape-split-ring-based
  phase discontinuity metasurface with liquid crystal elastomer as the substrate for
  infrared modulation of terahertz wavefront. Line-focused infrared light is applied
  to manipulate the deflection of the liquid crystal elastomer substrate, enabling
  controllable and broadband wavefront steering with a maximum output angle change
  of 22° at 0.68 THz. Heating as another control method is also investigated and compared
  with infrared control. We further demonstrate the performance of liquid crystal
  elastomer metasurface as a beam steerer, frequency modulator, and tunable beam splitter,
  which are highly desired in terahertz wireless communication and imaging systems.
  The proposed scheme demonstrates the promising prospects of mechanically deformable
  metasurfaces, thereby paving the path for the development of reconfigurable metasurfaces.
