 abstract = {Active metasurfaces are emerging as the core of next-generation optical devices with their tunable optical responses and flat-compact topography. Especially for the terahertz band, active metasurfaces have been developed as fascinating devices for optical chopping and compressive sensing imaging. However, performance regulation by changing the dielectric parameters of the integrated functional materials exhibits severe limitations and parasitic losses. Here, we introduce a C-shape-split-ring-based phase discontinuity metasurface with liquid crystal elastomer as the substrate for infrared modulation of terahertz wavefront. Line-focused infrared light is applied to manipulate the deflection of the liquid crystal elastomer substrate, enabling controllable and broadband wavefront steering with a maximum output angle change of 22° at 0.68 THz. Heating as another control method is also investigated and compared with infrared control. We further demonstrate the performance of liquid crystal elastomer metasurface as a beam steerer, frequency modulator, and tunable beam splitter, which are highly desired in terahertz wireless communication and imaging systems. The proposed scheme demonstrates the promising prospects of mechanically deformable metasurfaces, thereby paving the path for the development of reconfigurable metasurfaces.},
