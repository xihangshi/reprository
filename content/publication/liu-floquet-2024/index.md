abstract: Parity-time (PT) symmetry has been unveiling new photonic regimes in non-Hermitian
  systems, with opportunities for lasing, sensing and enhanced light-matter interactions.
  The most exotic responses emerge at the exceptional point (EP) and in the broken
  PT-symmetry phase, yet in conventional PT-symmetric systems these regimes require
  large levels of gain and loss, posing remarkable challenges in practical settings.
  Floquet PT-symmetry, which may be realized by periodically flipping the effective
  gain/loss distribution in time, can relax these requirements and tailor the EP and
  PT-symmetry phases through the modulation period. Here, we explore Floquet PT-symmetry
  in an integrated photonic waveguide platform, in which the role of time is replaced
  by the propagation direction. We experimentally demonstrate spontaneous PT-symmetry
  breaking at small gain/loss levels and efficient control of amplification and suppression
  through the excitation ports. Our work introduces the advantages of Floquet PT-symmetry
  in a practical integrated photonic setting, enabling a powerful platform to observe
  PT-symmetric phenomena and leverage their extreme features, with applications in
  nanophotonics, coherent control of nanoscale light amplification and routing.
