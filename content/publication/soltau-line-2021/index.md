abstract: X-ray in-line holography is well suited for three-dimensional imaging, since
  it covers a large field of view without the necessity of scanning. However, its
  resolution does not extend to the range covered by coherent diffractive imaging
  or ptychography. In this work, we show full-field holographic x-ray imaging based
  on cone-beam illumination, beyond the resolution limit given by the cone-beam numerical
  aperture. Image information encoded in far-field diffraction and in holographic
  self-interference is treated in a common reconstruction scheme, without the usual
  empty beam correction step of in-line holography. An illumination profile tailored
  by waveguide optics and exactly known by prior probe retrieval is shown to be sufficient
  for solving the phase problem. The approach paves the way toward high-resolution
  and dose-efficient x-ray tomography, well suited for the current upgrades of synchrotron
  radiation sources to diffraction-limited storage rings.
