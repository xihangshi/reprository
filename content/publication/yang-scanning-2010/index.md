abstract: Progress has been made in the development of four-dimensional ultrafast
  electron microscopy, which enables space-time imaging of structural dynamics in
  the condensed phase. In ultrafast electron microscopy, the electrons are accelerated,
  typically to 200Â keV, and the microscope operates in the transmission mode. Here,
  we report the development of scanning ultrafast electron microscopy using a field-emission-source
  configuration. Scanning of pulses is made in the single-electron mode, for which
  the pulse contains at most one or a few electrons, thus achieving imaging without
  the space-charge effect between electrons, and still in ten(s) of seconds. For imaging,
  the secondary electrons from surface structures are detected, as demonstrated here
  for material surfaces and biological specimens. By recording backscattered electrons,
  diffraction patterns from single crystals were also obtained. Scanning pulsed-electron
  microscopy with the acquired spatiotemporal resolutions, and its efficient heat-dissipation
  feature, is now poised to provide in situ 4D imaging and with environmental capability.
