abstract: Abstract We analytically describe the strong-field light-electron interaction
  using a quantized coherent laser state with arbitrary photon number. We obtain a
  light-electron wave function which is a closed-form solution of the time-dependent
  Schr√∂dinger equation (TDSE). This wave function provides information about the quantum
  optical features of the interaction not accessible by semi-classical theories. With
  this approach we can reveal the quantum optical properties of high harmonic generation
  (HHG) process in gases by measuring the photon statistics of the transmitted infrared
  (IR) laser radiation. This work can lead to novel experiments in high-resolution
  spectroscopy in extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) and attosecond science without the need
  to measure the XUV light, while it can pave the way for the development of intense
  non-classical light sources.
