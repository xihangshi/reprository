abstract: The nature of pulse propagation through a material with a negative value
  of the group velocity has been mysterious, as simple models seem to predict that
  pulses will propagate \"backward\" through such a material. Using an erbium-doped
  optical fiber and measuring the time evolution of the pulse intensity at many points
  within the fiber, we demonstrate that the peak of the pulse does propagate backward
  inside the fiber, even though the energy flow is always in the forward direction.
