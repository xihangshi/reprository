 abstract = {The quantum interaction between free electrons and photons is fundamental to free-electron based light sources and free-electron quantum optics applications. A large coupling between free electrons and photons is generally desired. In this manuscript, I study the upper bound for the quantum coupling between free electrons and photons. Our study provides guidance to reach the strong coupling between free electrons and photons.},
