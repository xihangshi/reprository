abstract: The quantum interaction between free electrons and photons is fundamental
  to free-electron based light sources and free-electron quantum optics applications.
  A large coupling between free electrons and photons is generally desired. In this
  manuscript, I study the upper bound for the quantum coupling between free electrons
  and photons. Our study provides guidance to reach the strong coupling between free
  electrons and photons.
