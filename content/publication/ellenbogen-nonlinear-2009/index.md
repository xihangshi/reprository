abstract: Recently, the first experimental observation of a new class of non-diffracting
  optical beams that freely accelerate in space was reported. These so-called Airy
  beams were shown to be useful for optical micro-manipulation of small particles
  and for the generation of curved plasma channels in air. To date, these beams have
  been generated only by using linear diffractive elements. Here, we show a new way
  of generating Airy beams by using three-wave mixing processes, which occur in asymmetric
  nonlinear photonic crystals. We experimentally generated a second-harmonic Airy
  beam and examined the tuning properties of the nonlinear interaction and propagation
  dynamics of the pump and second-harmonic output beams. This nonlinear generation
  process enables Airy beams to be obtained at new wavelengths, and opens up new possibilities
  for all-optical switching and manipulation of Airy beams.
