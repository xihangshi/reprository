abstract: Abstract Topological photonic states, inspired by robust chiral edge states
  in topological insulators, have recently been demonstrated in a few photonic systems,
  including an array of coupled on-chip ring resonators at communication wavelengths.
  However, the intrinsic difference between electrons and photons determines that
  the ‘topological protection’ in time-reversal-invariant photonic systems does not
  share the same robustness as its counterpart in electronic topological insulators.
  Here in a designer surface plasmon platform consisting of tunable metallic sub-wavelength
  structures, we construct photonic topological edge states and probe their robustness
  against a variety of defect classes, including some common time-reversal-invariant
  photonic defects that can break the topological protection, but do not exist in
  electronic topological insulators. This is also an experimental realization of anomalous
  Floquet topological edge states, whose topological phase cannot be predicted by
  the usual Chern number topological invariants.
