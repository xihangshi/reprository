 abstract = {Spatial modulation of electron beams is an essential tool for various applications such as nanolithography and imaging, yet its conventional implementations are severely limited and inherently non-tunable. Conversely, proposals of light-driven electron spatial modulation promise tunable electron wavefront shaping, for example, using the mechanism of photon-induced near-field electron microscopy. Here we present tunable photon-induced spatial modulation of electrons through their interaction with externally controlled surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs). Using recently developed methods of shaping SPP patterns, we demonstrate a dynamic control of the electron beam with a variety of electron distributions and verify their coherence through electron diffraction. Finally, the nonlinearity stemming from energy post-selection provides us with another avenue for controlling the electron shape, generating electron features far below the SPP wavelength. Our work paves the way to on-demand electron wavefront shaping at ultrafast timescales, with prospects for aberration correction, nanofabrication and material characterization.},
