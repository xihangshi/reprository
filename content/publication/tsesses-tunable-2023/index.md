abstract: Spatial modulation of electron beams is an essential tool for various applications
  such as nanolithography and imaging, yet its conventional implementations are severely
  limited and inherently non-tunable. Conversely, proposals of light-driven electron
  spatial modulation promise tunable electron wavefront shaping, for example, using
  the mechanism of photon-induced near-field electron microscopy. Here we present
  tunable photon-induced spatial modulation of electrons through their interaction
  with externally controlled surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs). Using recently developed
  methods of shaping SPP patterns, we demonstrate a dynamic control of the electron
  beam with a variety of electron distributions and verify their coherence through
  electron diffraction. Finally, the nonlinearity stemming from energy post-selection
  provides us with another avenue for controlling the electron shape, generating electron
  features far below the SPP wavelength. Our work paves the way to on-demand electron
  wavefront shaping at ultrafast timescales, with prospects for aberration correction,
  nanofabrication and material characterization.
