 abstract = {We experimentally demonstrate boosted in-plane thermal conduction by surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) propagating along a thin Ti film on a glass substrate. Due to the lossy nature of metal, SPPs can propagate over centimeter-scale distances even along a supported metal film, and the resulting ballistic heat conduction can be quantitatively validated. Further, for a 100-nm-thick Ti film on a glass substrate, a significant enhancement of in-plane thermal conductivity compared to bulk value (âˆ¼25%) is experimentally shown. This Letter will provide a new avenue to employ SPPs for heat dissipation along a supported thin film, which can be readily applied to mitigate hot-spot issues in microelectronics.},
