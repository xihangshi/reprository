abstract: We experimentally demonstrate boosted in-plane thermal conduction by surface
  plasmon polaritons (SPPs) propagating along a thin Ti film on a glass substrate.
  Due to the lossy nature of metal, SPPs can propagate over centimeter-scale distances
  even along a supported metal film, and the resulting ballistic heat conduction can
  be quantitatively validated. Further, for a 100-nm-thick Ti film on a glass substrate,
  a significant enhancement of in-plane thermal conductivity compared to bulk value
  (âˆ¼25%) is experimentally shown. This Letter will provide a new avenue to employ
  SPPs for heat dissipation along a supported thin film, which can be readily applied
  to mitigate hot-spot issues in microelectronics.
