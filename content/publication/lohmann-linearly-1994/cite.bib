 abstract = {Coherent bremsstrahlung is produced using the 855 MeV electron beam of the Mainz three-stage racetrack microtron MAMI and a diamond crystal inserted as a radiator into the MAMI tagging system. By counting only the electrons on the tagger ladder an intensity spectrum ranging from 50 MeV to 800 MeV was obtained with good statistical accuracy in a running time of 2 s. This short running time makes it possible to measure a complete intensity pattern versus photon energy for different orientations of the diamond crystal in about 15 minutes. By comparing these measured intensity patterns with calculations it becomes possible to precisely align the crystal axes with respect to the axes of the goniometer. Relative intensities of coherent bremsstrahlung are determined experimentally by normalizing the diamond data to data obtained with an amorphous Ni radiator. Good agreement is obtained between experiment and prediction when taking into account the beam divergence, multiple scattering of electrons in the radiator, the Z dependence of the bremsstrahlung spectrum and the finite Debye temperature of diamond. With a collimated photon beam having an aperture of half the characteristic angle degrees of linear polarization appear to be possible ranging from 80% at 200 MeV over 65% at 300 MeV and 55% at 400 MeV to 35% at 500 MeV.},
