abstract: Coherent bremsstrahlung is produced using the 855 MeV electron beam of the
  Mainz three-stage racetrack microtron MAMI and a diamond crystal inserted as a radiator
  into the MAMI tagging system. By counting only the electrons on the tagger ladder
  an intensity spectrum ranging from 50 MeV to 800 MeV was obtained with good statistical
  accuracy in a running time of 2 s. This short running time makes it possible to
  measure a complete intensity pattern versus photon energy for different orientations
  of the diamond crystal in about 15 minutes. By comparing these measured intensity
  patterns with calculations it becomes possible to precisely align the crystal axes
  with respect to the axes of the goniometer. Relative intensities of coherent bremsstrahlung
  are determined experimentally by normalizing the diamond data to data obtained with
  an amorphous Ni radiator. Good agreement is obtained between experiment and prediction
  when taking into account the beam divergence, multiple scattering of electrons in
  the radiator, the Z dependence of the bremsstrahlung spectrum and the finite Debye
  temperature of diamond. With a collimated photon beam having an aperture of half
  the characteristic angle degrees of linear polarization appear to be possible ranging
  from 80% at 200 MeV over 65% at 300 MeV and 55% at 400 MeV to 35% at 500 MeV.
