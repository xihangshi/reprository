abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) materials with magnetic order have been heavily pursued
  for fundamental physics as well as for device design. Despite the rapid advances,
  so far, they are mainly insulating or semiconducting, and none of them has a high
  electronic mobility—a property that is rare in layered vdW materials in general.
  The realization of a high-mobility vdW material that also exhibits magnetic order
  would open the possibility for novel magnetic twistronic or spintronic devices.
  Here, we report very high carrier mobility in the layered vdW antiferromagnet GdTe3.
  The electron mobility is beyond 60,000 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is the highest among all
  known layered magnetic materials, to the best of our knowledge. Among all known
  vdW materials, the mobility of bulk GdTe3 is comparable to that of black phosphorus.
  By mechanical exfoliation, we further demonstrate that GdTe3 can be exfoliated to
  ultrathin flakes of three monolayers.
