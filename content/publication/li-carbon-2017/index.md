abstract: Ultrafast electron pulses, combined with laser-pump and electron-probe technologies,
  allow ultrafast dynamics to be characterized in materials. However, the pursuit
  of simultaneous ultimate spatial and temporal resolution of microscopy and spectroscopy
  is largely subdued by the low monochromaticity of the electron pulses and their
  poor phase synchronization to the optical excitation pulses. Field-driven photoemission
  from metal tips provides high light-phase synchronization, but suffers large electron
  energy spreads (3?100 eV) as driven by a long wavelength laser (textgreater800 nm).
  Here, ultrafast electron emission from carbon nanotubes (â‰ˆ1 nm radius) excited by
  a 410 nm femtosecond laser is realized in the field-driven regime. In addition,
  the emitted electrons have great monochromaticity with energy spread as low as 0.25
  eV. This great performance benefits from the extraordinarily high field enhancement
  and great stability of carbon nanotubes, superior to metal tips. The new nanotube-based
  ultrafast electron source opens exciting prospects for extending current characterization
  to sub-femtosecond temporal resolution as well as sub-nanometer spatial resolution.
