 abstract = {A quantum theory is developed for a type of coherent x-ray radiation observed recently. It is shown that the lowest-order coherent-radiation processes due to the interaction between the particle and the crystal electrons are classified into two kinds: electronic bremsstrahlung and x-ray radiation. An analytical expression for the radiation probability is derived using quantum electrodynamics. For ultrarelativistic particles, our quantum expression yields the classical formula by Ter-Mikaelian, in agreement with the experimental results. Â© 1992 The American Physical Society.},
