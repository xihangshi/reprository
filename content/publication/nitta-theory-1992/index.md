abstract: 'A quantum theory is developed for a type of coherent x-ray radiation observed
  recently. It is shown that the lowest-order coherent-radiation processes due to
  the interaction between the particle and the crystal electrons are classified into
  two kinds: electronic bremsstrahlung and x-ray radiation. An analytical expression
  for the radiation probability is derived using quantum electrodynamics. For ultrarelativistic
  particles, our quantum expression yields the classical formula by Ter-Mikaelian,
  in agreement with the experimental results. Â© 1992 The American Physical Society.'
