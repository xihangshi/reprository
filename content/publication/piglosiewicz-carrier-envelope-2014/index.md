abstract: Sharp metallic nanotapers irradiated with few-cycle laser pulses are emerging
  as a source of highly confined coherent electron wave packets with attosecond duration
  and strong directivity1,2,3,4,5,6. The possibility to steer, control or switch such
  electron wave packets with light7 is expected to pave the way towards direct visualization
  of nanoplasmonic field dynamics8,9,10 and real-time probing of electron motion11,12
  in solid-state nanostructures13,14. Such pulses can be generated by strong-field-induced
  tunnelling and acceleration of electrons in the near-field of sharp gold tapers
  within one half-cycle of the driving laser field1,2,5. Here, we show the effect
  of the carrier-envelope phase of the laser field on the generation and motion of
  strong-field-emitted electrons from such tips. We observe clear variations in the
  width of plateau-like photoelectron spectra characteristic of the subcycle regime.
  This is a step towards controlling the coherent electron motion in and around metallic
  nanostructures over ultrashort lengths and timescales.
