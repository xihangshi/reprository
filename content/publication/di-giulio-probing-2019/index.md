abstract: Probing optical excitations with nanometer resolution is important for understanding
  their dynamics and interactions down to the atomic scale. Electron microscopes currently
  offer the unparalleled ability of rendering spatially resolved electron spectra
  with combined meV and sub-nm resolution, while the use of ultrafast optical pulses
  enables fs temporal resolution and exposure of the electrons to ultraintense confined
  optical fields. Here, we theoretically investigate fundamental aspects of the interaction
  of fast electrons with localized optical modes that are made possible by these advances.
  We use a quantum optics description of the optical field to predict that the resulting
  electron spectra strongly depend on the statistics of the sample excitations (bosonic
  or fermionic) and their population (Fock, coherent, or thermal), whose autocorrelation
  functions are directly retrieved from the ratios of electron gain intensities. We
  further explore feasible experimental scenarios to probe the quantum characteristics
  of the sampled excitations and their populations. In particular, we present realistic
  simulations for electron beams interacting with optical cavities infiltrated with
  optically pumped quantum emitters, which we show to undergo a varied temporal evolution
  in the cavity mode statistics that causes radical modifications in the transmitted
  electron spectra depending on pump-electron delay.
