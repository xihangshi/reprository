abstract: Spontaneous light emission is central to a vast range of physical systems
  and is a founding pillar for the theory of light–matter interactions. In the presence
  of complex photonic media, the description of spontaneous light emission usually
  requires advanced theoretical quantum optics tools such as macroscopic quantum electrodynamics,
  involving quantized electromagnetic fields. Although rigorous and comprehensive,
  the complexity of such models can obscure the intuitive understanding of many quantum-optical
  phenomena. Here, we review a method for calculating spontaneous emission and other
  quantum-optical processes without making explicit use of quantized electromagnetic
  fields. Instead, we introduce the concept of transition currents, comprising charges
  in matter that undergo transitions between initial and final quantum states. We
  show how predictions that usually demand advanced methods in quantum electrodynamics
  or quantum optics can be reproduced by feeding these transition currents as sources
  to the classical Maxwell equations. One then obtains the relevant quantum observables
  from the resulting classical field amplitudes, without washing out quantum optical
  effects. We show that this procedure allows for a straightforward description of
  quantum phenomena, even when going beyond the dipole approximation and single emitters.
  As illustrative examples, we calculate emission patterns and Purcell-enhanced emission
  rates in both bound-electron and free-electron systems. For the latter, we derive
  cathodoluminescence emission and energy-loss probabilities of free electrons interacting
  with nanostructured samples. In addition, we calculate quantum-beat phenomena in
  bound-electron systems and wave function-dependent optical coherence in free-electron
  systems. Remarkably, the transition-current formalism captures more complex phenomena,
  such as many-body interference effects and super-radiance of both bound- and free-electron
  systems, second-order processes such as two-photon emission, and quantum recoil
  corrections to free-electron radiation. We review a variety of light–matter interactions
  in fields ranging from electron microscopy to nanophotonics and quantum optics,
  for which the transition-current theoretical formalism facilitates practical simulations
  and a deeper understanding of novel applications.
