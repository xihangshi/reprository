abstract: Flatbands have become a cornerstone of contemporary condensed-matter physics
  and photonics. In electronics, flatbands entail comparable energy bandwidth and
  Coulomb interaction, leading to correlated phenomena such as the fractional quantum
  Hall effect and recently those in magic-angle systems. In photonics, they enable
  properties including slow light1 and lasing2. Notably, flatbands support supercollimation—diffractionless
  wavepacket propagation—in both systems3,4. Despite these intense parallel efforts,
  flatbands have never been shown to affect the core interaction between free electrons
  and photons. Their interaction, pivotal for free-electron lasers5, microscopy and
  spectroscopy6,7, and particle accelerators8,9, is, in fact, limited by a dimensionality
  mismatch between localized electrons and extended photons. Here we reveal theoretically
  that photonic flatbands can overcome this mismatch and thus remarkably boost their
  interaction. We design flatband resonances in a silicon-on-insulator photonic crystal
  slab to control and enhance the associated free-electron radiation by tuning their
  trajectory and velocity. We observe signatures of flatband enhancement, recording
  a two-order increase from the conventional diffraction-enabled Smith–Purcell radiation.
  The enhancement enables polarization shaping of free-electron radiation and characterization of
  photonic bands through electron-beam measurements. Our results support the use of
  flatbands as test beds for strong light–electron interaction, particularly relevant
  for efficient and compact free-electron light sources and accelerators.
