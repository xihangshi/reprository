 abstract = {Spontaneous parametric down-conversion is a vital method for generating correlated photon pairs in the visible and near-infrared spectral regions; however, its extension to X-ray frequencies has faced substantial barriers. Here, we present an advancement in correlated X-ray pair generation and detection by employing a two-dimensional pixelated detector to obtain the first direct image of the pair distribution. Our study explores and directly visualizes the down-conversion process, revealing the characteristic ring structure of coincident photon pairs and demonstrating robust spatial correlations. A significant finding is the observation of energy anti-correlation, achieved at an unprecedented rate of approximately 4,100 pairs/hour, far exceeding previous reports in the literature. We believe these results represent a significant leap in X-ray quantum imaging, unlocking the potential for enhanced imaging of biological materials with reduced doses and broadening the applicability of X-ray quantum optical technologies.},
