abstract: Spontaneous parametric down-conversion is a vital method for generating
  correlated photon pairs in the visible and near-infrared spectral regions; however,
  its extension to X-ray frequencies has faced substantial barriers. Here, we present
  an advancement in correlated X-ray pair generation and detection by employing a
  two-dimensional pixelated detector to obtain the first direct image of the pair
  distribution. Our study explores and directly visualizes the down-conversion process,
  revealing the characteristic ring structure of coincident photon pairs and demonstrating
  robust spatial correlations. A significant finding is the observation of energy
  anti-correlation, achieved at an unprecedented rate of approximately 4,100 pairs/hour,
  far exceeding previous reports in the literature. We believe these results represent
  a significant leap in X-ray quantum imaging, unlocking the potential for enhanced
  imaging of biological materials with reduced doses and broadening the applicability
  of X-ray quantum optical technologies.
