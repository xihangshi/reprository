abstract: Smith-Purcell radiation has emerged as a crucial platform for investigating
  light-matter interactions and developing compact, tunable light sources that span
  from microwaves to X-rays. In classical theory, it is believed that Cherenkov radiation
  exhibits an energy threshold for electrons, while Smith-Purcell radiation
  is considered free of such a threshold. Although quantum theory suggests there is
  an emission cutoff in Smith-Purcell radiation, the behavior of this radiation
  near the threshold remains understudied. In this article, we address this gap by
  examining the behavior of Smith-Purcell radiation near the threshold from
  quantum perspectives. Specifically, we derive a quantum energy threshold based on
  energy-momentum conservation, providing a rigorous limit for the onset of Smith-Purcell
  radiation. Furthermore, we find that around the threshold the incident electron
  emits a photon and subsequently reverses its direction of motion. Additionally,
  we establish a classical energy threshold&#x2014;below which the classical theory
  breaks down&#x2014;by applying the Duane-Hunt limit to Smith-Purcell radiation.
  Accordingly, quantum theory is required when the electron energy falls between the
  classical and quantum thresholds. Our findings enrich the understanding of Smith-Purcell
  radiation and provide valuable insights for developing low-energy-driven and heralded
  quantum light sources.
