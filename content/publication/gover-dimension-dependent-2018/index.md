abstract: In the foundation of quantum mechanics, the spatial dimensions of electron
  wavepacket are understood only in terms of an expectation value – the probability
  distribution of the particle location. One can still inquire how the quantum electron
  wavepacket size affects a physical process. Here we address the fundamental physics
  problem of particle–wave duality and the measurability of a free electron quantum
  wavepacket. Our analysis of stimulated radiative interaction of an electron wavepacket,
  accompanied by numerical computations, reveals two limits. In the quantum regime
  of long wavepacket size relative to radiation wavelength, one obtains only quantum-recoil
  multiphoton sidebands in the electron energy spectrum. In the opposite regime, the
  wavepacket interaction approaches the limit of classical point-particle acceleration.
  The wavepacket features can be revealed in experiments carried out in the intermediate
  regime of wavepacket size commensurate with the radiation wavelength.
