abstract: Multilayer Laue lenses are volume diffractive optical elements for hard
  X-rays with the potential to focus beams to sizes as small as 1 nm. This ability
  is limited by the precision of the manufacturing process, whereby systematic errors
  that arise during fabrication contribute to wavefront aberrations even after calibration
  of the deposition process based on wavefront metrology. Such aberrations can be
  compensated by using a phase plate. However, current high numerical aperture lenses
  for nanometer resolution exhibit errors that exceed those that can be corrected
  by a single phase plate. To address this, we accumulate a large wavefront correction
  by propagation through a linear array of 3D-printed phase correcting elements. With
  such a compound refractive corrector, we report on a point spread function with
  a full-width at half maximum area of 2.9 × 2.8 nm 2 at a photon energy of 17.5 keV.
