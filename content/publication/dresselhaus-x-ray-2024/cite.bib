 abstract = {Multilayer Laue lenses are volume diffractive optical elements for hard X-rays with the potential to focus beams to sizes as small as 1 nm. This ability is limited by the precision of the manufacturing process, whereby systematic errors that arise during fabrication contribute to wavefront aberrations even after calibration of the deposition process based on wavefront metrology. Such aberrations can be compensated by using a phase plate. However, current high numerical aperture lenses for nanometer resolution exhibit errors that exceed those that can be corrected by a single phase plate. To address this, we accumulate a large wavefront correction by propagation through a linear array of 3D-printed phase correcting elements. With such a compound refractive corrector, we report on a point spread function with a full-width at half maximum area of 2.9 × 2.8 nm
