abstract: This article presents a unified formulation and review of an extensive class
  of radiation effects and devices based on free or quasifree electrons. The effects
  and devices reviewed include slow-wave radiators [such as erenkov, Smith-Purcell,
  and TWT (traveling-wave tube) effects and devices], periodic bremsstrahlung radiators
  [such as undulator radiation, magnetic bremsstrahlung FEL's (free-electron lasers),
  and coherent bremsstrahlung in the crystal lattice], and transverse-binding radiators
  [such as the CRM (cyclotron resonance maser) and channeling radiation]. Starting
  from a general quantum- electrodynamic model, both quantum and classical effects
  and operating regimes of these radiation devices are described. The article provides
  a unified physical description of the interaction kinematics, and presents equations
  for the characterization of spontaneous and stimulated radiative emission in these
  various effects and devices. Universal relations between the spontaneous and stimulated
  emission parameters are revealed and shown to be related (in the quantum limit)
  to Einstein relations for atomic radiators and (in the classical limit) to the relations
  derived by Madey for magnetic bremsstrahlung FEL for on-axis radiative emission.
  Examples for the application of the formulation are given, estimating the feasibility
  of channeling radiation x-ray laser and optical regime Smith-Purcell FEL, and deriving
  the gain equations of magnetic bremsstrahlung FEL and CRM for arbitrary electron
  propagation direction, structure (wiggler) axis, and radiative emission angle. ©
