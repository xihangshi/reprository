abstract: Graphene is nature's thinnest elastic material and displays exceptional
  mechanical and electronic properties. Ripples are an intrinsic feature of graphene
  sheets and are expected to strongly influence electronic properties by inducing
  effective magnetic fields and changing local potentials. The ability to control
  ripple structure in graphene could allow device design based on local strain and
  selective bandgap engineering. Here, we report the first direct observation and
  controlled creation of one- and two-dimensional periodic ripples in suspended graphene
  sheets, using both spontaneously and thermally generated strains. We are able to
  control ripple orientation, wavelength and amplitude by controlling boundary conditions
  and making use of graphene's negative thermal expansion coefficient (TEC), which
  we measure to be much larger than that of graphite. These results elucidate the
  ripple formation process, which can be understood in terms of classical thin-film
  elasticity theory. This should lead to an improved understanding of suspended graphene
  devices, a controlled engineering of thermal stress in large-scale graphene electronics,
  and a systematic investigation of the effect of ripples on the electronic properties
  of graphene. Â© 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.
