 abstract = {Ptychographic coherent diffractive imaging enables diffraction-limited imaging of nanoscale structures at extreme ultraviolet and x-ray wavelengths, where high-quality image-forming optics are not available. However, its reliance on a set of diverse diffraction patterns makes it challenging to use ptychography to image highly periodic samples, limiting its application to defect inspection for electronic and photonic devices. Here, we use a vortex high harmonic light beam driven by a laser carrying orbital angular momentum to implement extreme ultraviolet ptychographic imaging of highly periodic samples with high fidelity and reliability. We also demonstrate, for the first time to our knowledge, ptychographic imaging of an isolated, near-diffraction-limited defect in an otherwise periodic sample using vortex high harmonic beams. This enhanced metrology technique can enable high-fidelity imaging and inspection of highly periodic structures for next-generation nano, energy, photonic, and quantum devices.},
