abstract: Ptychographic coherent diffractive imaging enables diffraction-limited imaging
  of nanoscale structures at extreme ultraviolet and x-ray wavelengths, where high-quality
  image-forming optics are not available. However, its reliance on a set of diverse
  diffraction patterns makes it challenging to use ptychography to image highly periodic
  samples, limiting its application to defect inspection for electronic and photonic
  devices. Here, we use a vortex high harmonic light beam driven by a laser carrying
  orbital angular momentum to implement extreme ultraviolet ptychographic imaging
  of highly periodic samples with high fidelity and reliability. We also demonstrate,
  for the first time to our knowledge, ptychographic imaging of an isolated, near-diffraction-limited
  defect in an otherwise periodic sample using vortex high harmonic beams. This enhanced
  metrology technique can enable high-fidelity imaging and inspection of highly periodic
  structures for next-generation nano, energy, photonic, and quantum devices.
