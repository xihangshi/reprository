abstract: Tip-based photoemission electron sources offer unique properties for ultrafast
  imaging, diffraction, and spectroscopy experiments with highly coherent few-electron
  pulses. Extending this approach to increased bunch-charges requires a comprehensive
  experimental study on Coulomb interactions in nanoscale electron pulses and their
  impact on beam quality. For a laser-driven Schottky field emitter, we assess the
  transverse and longitudinal electron pulse properties in an ultrafast transmission
  electron microscope at a high photoemission current density. A quantitative characterization
  of electron beam emittance, pulse duration, spectral bandwidth, and chirp is performed.
  Due to the cathode geometry, Coulomb interactions in the pulse predominantly occur
  in the direct vicinity to the tip apex, resulting in a well-defined pulse chirp
  and limited emittance growth. Strategies for optimizing electron source parameters
  are identified, enabling advanced ultrafast transmission electron microscopy approaches,
  such as phase-resolved imaging and holography.
