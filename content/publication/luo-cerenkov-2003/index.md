abstract: In a conventional material, the coherent Cerenkov radiation due to a moving
  charged particle is associated with a velocity threshold, a forward-pointing radiation
  cone, and a forward direction of emission. We describe different behavior for the
  Cerenkov radiation in a photonic crystal. In particular, this radiation is intrinsically
  coupled with transition radiation and is observable without any threshold. Within
  one particle-velocity range, we found a radiation pattern with a backward-pointing
  radiation cone. In another velocity range, backward-propagating Cerenkov radiation
  can be expected. Potential applications include velocity-sensitive particle detection
  and radiation generation at selectable frequencies.
