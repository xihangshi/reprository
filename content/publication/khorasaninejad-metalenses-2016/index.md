abstract: Subwavelength resolution imaging requires high numerical aperture (NA) lenses,
  which are bulky and expensive. Metasurfaces allow the miniaturization of conventional
  refractive optics into planar structures. We show that high-aspect-ratio titanium
  dioxide metasurfaces can be fabricated and designed as metalenses with NA = 0.8.
  Diffraction-limited focusing is demonstrated at wavelengths of 405, 532, and 660
  nm with corresponding efficiencies of 86, 73, and 66%. The metalenses can resolve
  nanoscale features separated by subwavelength distances and provide magnification
  as high as 170Ã—, with image qualities comparable to a state-of-the-art commercial
  objective. Our results firmly establish that metalenses can have widespread applications
  in laser-based microscopy, imaging, and spectroscopy.
