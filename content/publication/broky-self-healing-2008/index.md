abstract: We investigate both theoretically and experimentally the self-healing properties
  of accelerating Airy beams. We show that this class of waves tends to reform during
  propagation in spite of the severity of the imposed perturbations. In all occasions
  the reconstruction of these beams is interpreted through their internal transverse
  power flow. The robustness of these optical beams in scattering and turbulent environments
  is also studied experimentally. Our observations are in excellent agreement with
  numerical simulations.
