abstract: Photon number distributions of classical and non-classical light sources
  have been studied extensively, yet their impact on photoemission processes is largely
  unexplored. In this article, we present measurements of electron number distributions
  from metal needle tips illuminated with ultrashort light pulses with various photon
  quantum statistics. By varying the photon statistics of the exciting light field
  between classical (Poissonian) and quantum (super-Poissonian), we demonstrate that
  the measured electron distributions are changed substantially. Using single-mode
  bright squeezed vacuum light, we measure extreme statistics events with up to 65
  electrons from one light pulse at a mean of 0.27 electrons per pulse—the likelihood
  for such an event equals 10−128 with Poissonian statistics. By changing the number
  of modes of the exciting bright squeezed vacuum, we can tailor the electron number
  distribution on demand. Most importantly, our results demonstrate that the photon
  statistics is imprinted from the driving light to the emitted electrons, opening
  the door to new sensor devices and to strong-field optics with quantum light and
  electrons.
