abstract: We used quantitative phase tomography with synchrotron radiation to elucidate
  the 3D structure of Arabidopsis seeds in their native state. The cells are clearly
  distinguished, and their internal structure is revealed through local variations
  in electron density. We visualized a 3D network of intercellular air space that
  might allow immediate gas exchange for energy supply during germination and/or serve
  for rapid water uptake and distribution during imbibition.
