 abstract = {We used quantitative phase tomography with synchrotron radiation to elucidate the 3D structure of Arabidopsis seeds in their native state. The cells are clearly distinguished, and their internal structure is revealed through local variations in electron density. We visualized a 3D network of intercellular air space that might allow immediate gas exchange for energy supply during germination and/or serve for rapid water uptake and distribution during imbibition.},
