abstract: 'Generating attosecond pulses has required a radically different approach
  from previous ultrafast optical methods. The technology of attosecond measurement,
  however, is built on established methods of characterizing femtosecond pulses: the
  pulse is measured after it has left the region where it was produced. We offer a
  completely different approach: in situ measurement. That is, we integrate attosecond-pulse
  production and measurement in a manner that can be applied to many high-order nonlinear
  interactions. To demonstrate this approach, we combine a low-intensity (textless10−3)
  second-harmonic beam with the fundamental beam, to gently perturb the production
  process without significantly modifying it. The attosecond-pulse duration is read
  from the modulation of the even-harmonic signal as a function of the two-field delay.
  Increasing the second-harmonic intensity slightly (textless10−2), we extend measurement
  to control. We demonstrate control by manipulating the high-harmonic spectrum with
  high efficiency.'
