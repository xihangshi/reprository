abstract: Advances in attosecond spectroscopy have enabled tracing and controlling
  the electron motion dynamics in matter, although they have yielded insufficient
  information about the electron dynamic in the space domain. Hence, ultrafast electron
  and x-ray imaging tools have been developed to image the ultrafast dynamics of matter
  in real time and space. The cutting-edge temporal resolution of these imaging tools
  is on the order of a few tens to a hundred femtoseconds, limiting imaging to the
  atomic dynamics and leaving electron motion imaging out of reach. Here, we obtained
  the attosecond temporal resolution in the transmission electron microscope, which
  we coined “attomicroscopy.” We demonstrated this resolution by the attosecond diffraction
  measurements of the field-driven electron dynamics in graphene. This attosecond
  imaging tool would provide more insights into electron motion and directly connect
  it to the structural dynamics of matter in real-time and space domains, opening
  the door for long-anticipated real-life attosecond science applications in quantum
  physics, chemistry, and biology. ,  Attosecond electron microscopy is demonstrated
  and used to image the graphene electron motion in action.
