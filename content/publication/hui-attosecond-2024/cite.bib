 abstract = {Advances in attosecond spectroscopy have enabled tracing and controlling the electron motion dynamics in matter, although they have yielded insufficient information about the electron dynamic in the space domain. Hence, ultrafast electron and x-ray imaging tools have been developed to image the ultrafast dynamics of matter in real time and space. The cutting-edge temporal resolution of these imaging tools is on the order of a few tens to a hundred femtoseconds, limiting imaging to the atomic dynamics and leaving electron motion imaging out of reach. Here, we obtained the attosecond temporal resolution in the transmission electron microscope, which we coined “attomicroscopy.” We demonstrated this resolution by the attosecond diffraction measurements of the field-driven electron dynamics in graphene. This attosecond imaging tool would provide more insights into electron motion and directly connect it to the structural dynamics of matter in real-time and space domains, opening the door for long-anticipated real-life attosecond science applications in quantum physics, chemistry, and biology.
