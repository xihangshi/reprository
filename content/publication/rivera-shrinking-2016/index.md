abstract: The diversity of light-matter interactions accessible to a system is limited
  by the small size of an atom relative to the wavelength of the light it emits, as
  well as by the small value of the fine-structure constant. We developed a general
  theory of light-matter interactions with two-dimensional systems supporting plasmons.
  These plasmons effectively make the fine-structure constant larger and bridge the
  size gap between atom and light. This theory reveals that conventionally forbidden
  light-matter interactions-such as extremely high-order multipolar transitions, two-plasmon
  spontaneous emission, and singlet-triplet phosphorescence processes-can occur on
  very short time scales comparable to those of conventionally fast transitions. Our
  findings may lead to new platforms for spectroscopy, sensing, and broadband light
  generation, a potential testing ground for quantum electrodynamics (QED) in the
  ultrastrong coupling regime, and the ability to take advantage of the full electronic
  spectrum of an emitter.
