abstract: This Letter sets a road map towards an experimental realization of strong
  coupling between free electrons and photons and analytically explores entanglement
  phenomena that emerge in this regime. The proposed model unifies the strong-coupling
  predictions with known electron-photon interactions. Additionally, this Letter predicts
  a non-Columbic entanglement between freely propagating electrons. Since strong coupling
  can map entanglements between photon pairs onto photon-electron pairs, it may harness
  electron beams for quantum communication, thus far exclusive to photons.
