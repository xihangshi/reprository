abstract: Abstract Free-electron radiation phenomena facilitate enticing potential
  to create light emission with highly tunable spectra, covering hard-to-reach frequencies
  ranging from microwave to X-ray. Consequently, they take part in many applications
  such as on-chip light sources, particle accelerators, and medical imaging. While
  their spectral tunability is extremely high, their polarizability is usually much
  harder to control. Such limitations are especially apparent in all free electron
  based spontaneous radiation sources, such as the Smith?Purcell (SP) radiation. Here,
  anomalous free-electron radiation phenomenon is demonstrated at the microwave regime
  from gradient bianisotropic metasurfaces, by using a phased dipole array to mimics
  moving charged particles. The phase gradient and the bianisotropy in metasurfaces
  provide new degrees of freedom for the polarization shaping of free-electron radiation,
  going beyond the common spectral and angular shaping. Remarkably, the observed anomalous
  free-electron radiation obeys a generalized SP formula derived from Fermat's principle.
