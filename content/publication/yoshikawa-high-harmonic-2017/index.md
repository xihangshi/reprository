abstract: Graphene takes light to a higher level High harmonic generation is a useful
  nonlinear effect in which the light-matter interaction within a material results
  in the conversion of one wavelength to a shorter one. Typically performed in atomic
  gases, there is now interest in extending such a process to the solid state. Yoshikawa
  et al. pumped single-layer graphene with intense polarized pulses of infrared light
  to generate ultraviolet light, up to the ninth harmonic. Theoretical analysis of
  the process suggests that the effect could be transferred to other solid-state systems,
  providing a possible route to develop coherent light sources across the spectrum.
  Science , this issue p. 736 , High-harmonic generation is observed in single-layer
  graphene. , The electronic properties of graphene can give rise to a range of nonlinear
  optical responses. One of the most desirable nonlinear optical processes is high-harmonic
  generation (HHG) originating from coherent electron motion induced by an intense
  light field. Here, we report on the observation of up to ninth-order harmonics in
  graphene excited by mid-infrared laser pulses at room temperature. The HHG in graphene
  is enhanced by an elliptically polarized laser excitation, and the resultant harmonic
  radiation has a particular polarization. The observed ellipticity dependence is
  reproduced by a fully quantum mechanical treatment of HHG in solids. The zero-gap
  nature causes the unique properties of HHG in graphene, and our findings open up
  the possibility of investigating strong-field and ultrafast dynamics and nonlinear
  behavior of massless Dirac fermions.
