abstract: Abstract High‐performance focusing of X‐rays requires the realization of
  very challenging 3D geometries with nanoscale features, sub‐millimeter‐scale apertures,
  and high aspect ratios. A particularly difficult structure is the profile of an
  ideal zone plate called a kinoform, which is manufactured in nonideal approximated
  patterns, nonetheless requires complicated multistep fabrication processes. Here,
  3D fabrication of high‐performance kinoforms with unprecedented aspect ratios out
  of low‐loss plastics using femtosecond two‐photon 3D nanoprinting is presented.
  A thorough characterization of the 3D‐printed kinoforms using direct soft X‐ray
  imaging and ptychography demonstrates superior performance with an efficiency reaching
  up to 20%. An extended concept is proposed for on‐chip integration of various X‐ray
  optics toward high‐fidelity control of X‐ray wavefronts and ultimate efficiencies
  even for harder X‐rays. Initial results establish new, advanced focusing optics
  for both synchrotron and laboratory sources for a large variety of X‐ray techniques
  and applications ranging from materials science to medicine.
