High‐performance focusing of X‐rays requires the realization of very challenging 3D geometries with nanoscale features, sub‐millimeter‐scale apertures, and high aspect ratios. A particularly difficult structure is the profile of an ideal zone plate called a kinoform, which is manufactured in nonideal approximated patterns, nonetheless requires complicated multistep fabrication processes. Here, 3D fabrication of high‐performance kinoforms with unprecedented aspect ratios out of low‐loss plastics using femtosecond two‐photon 3D nanoprinting is presented. A thorough characterization of the 3D‐printed kinoforms using direct soft X‐ray imaging and ptychography demonstrates superior performance with an efficiency reaching up to 20%. An extended concept is proposed for on‐chip integration of various X‐ray optics toward high‐fidelity control of X‐ray wavefronts and ultimate efficiencies even for harder X‐rays. Initial results establish new, advanced focusing optics for both synchrotron and laboratory sources for a large variety of X‐ray techniques and applications ranging from materials science to medicine.},
