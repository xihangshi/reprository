abstract: Extracting light from silicon is a longstanding challenge in modern engineering
  and physics. While silicon has underpinned the past 70 years of electronics advancement,
  a facile tunable and efficient silicon-based light source remains elusive. Here,
  we experimentally demonstrate the generation of tunable radiation from a one-dimensional,
  all-silicon nanograting. Light is generated by the spontaneous emission from the
  interaction of these nanogratings with low-energy free electrons (2–20 keV) and
  is recorded in the wavelength range of 800–1600 nm, which includes the silicon transparency
  window. Tunable free-electron-based light generation from nanoscale silicon gratings
  with efficiencies approaching those from metallic gratings is demonstrated. We theoretically
  investigate the feasibility of a scalable, compact, all-silicon tunable light source
  comprised of a silicon Field Emitter Array integrated with a silicon nanograting
  that emits at telecommunication wavelengths. Our results reveal the prospects of
  a CMOS-compatible electrically-pumped silicon light source for possible applications
  in the mid-infrared and telecommunication wavelengths.
