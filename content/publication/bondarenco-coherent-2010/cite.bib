 abstract = {Coherent radiation spectrum from high energy e± in a bent crystal with arbitrary curvature distribution along the longitudinal coordinate is evaluated, based on the stationary phase approximation. For a uniformly bent crystal a closed-form expression for the spectrum is derived. The spectrum features include a dip at its beginning and the sharp end, which may split into two breaks depending on the particle incidence angle. Estimates of nondipole radiation and multiple scattering effects are given. The value for the crystal bending angle at which the dipole coherent bremsstrahlung theory holds best appears to be ∼10-4 rad. © 2010 The American Physical Society.},
