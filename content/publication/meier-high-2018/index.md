abstract: Nanometer-sharp metallic tips are known to be excellent electron emitters.
  They are used in highest-resolution electron microscopes in cold field emission
  mode to generate the most coherent electron beam in continuous-wave operation. For
  time-resolved operation, sharp metal needle tips have recently been triggered with
  femtosecond laser pulses. We show here that electrons emitted with near-infrared
  femtosecond laser pulses at laser oscillator repetition rates show the same spatial
  coherence properties as electrons in cold field emission mode in cw operation. From
  electron interference fringes, obtained with the help of a carbon nanotube biprism
  beam splitter, we deduce a virtual source size of less than (0.65 ± 0.06) nm for
  both operation modes, a factor of ten smaller than the geometrical source size.
  These results bear promise for ultrafast electron diffraction, ultrafast electron
  microscopy, and other techniques relying on highly coherent and ultrafast electron
  beams.
