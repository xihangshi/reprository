abstract: Nanoblisters such as nanobubbles and nanotents formed by two-dimensional
  (2D) materials have been extensively exploited for strain engineering purposes as
  they can produce self-sustained, nonuniform in-plane strains through out-of-plane
  deformation. However, deterministic measure and control of strain fields in these
  systems are challenging because of the atomic thinness and unconventional interface
  behaviors of 2D materials. Here, we experimentally characterize a simple and unified
  power law for the profiles of a variety of nanobubbles and nanotents formed by 2D
  materials such as graphene and MoS2 layers. Using membrane theory, we analytically
  unveil what sets the in-plane strains of these blisters regarding their shape and
  interface characteristics. Our analytical solutions are validated by Raman spectroscopy
  measured strain distributions in bulged graphene bubbles supported by strong and
  weak shear interfaces. We advocate that both the strain magnitudes and distributions
  can be tuned by 2D material-substrate interface adhesion and friction properties.
