abstract: The physics of two-dimensional (2D) materials and heterostructures based
  on such crystals has been developing extremely fast. With these new materials, truly
  2D physics has begun to appear (for instance, the absence of long-range order, 2D
  excitons, commensurate-incommensurate transition, etc.). Novel heterostructure devices
  - such as tunneling transistors, resonant tunneling diodes, and light-emitting diodes
  - are also starting to emerge. Composed from individual 2D crystals, such devices
  use the properties of those materials to create functionalities that are not accessible
  in other heterostructures. Here we review the properties of novel 2D crystals and
  examine how their properties are used in new heterostructure devices.
