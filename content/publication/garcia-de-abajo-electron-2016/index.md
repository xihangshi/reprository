abstract: An electron beam traversing a structured plasmonic field is shown to undergo
  diffraction with characteristic angular patterns of both elastic and inelastic outgoing
  electron components. In particular, a plasmonic grating (e.g., a standing wave formed
  by two counterpropagating plasmons in a thin film) produces diffraction orders of
  the same parity as the net number of exchanged plasmons. Large diffracted beam fractions
  are predicted to occur for realistic plasmon intensities in attainable geometries
  due to a combination of phase and amplitude changes locally imprinted on the passing
  electron wave. Our study opens vistas in the study of multiphoton exchanges between
  electron beams and evanescent optical fields with unexplored effects related to
  the transversal component of the electron wave function.
