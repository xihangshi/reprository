abstract: Measurements of urinary flow rate were performed in 16 patients with established
  prostatitis before and after a course of antimicrobial therapy. Before treatment
  the maximum flow rates were poor with abnormal flow curves and significant improvement
  in voiding characteristics were observed with treatment (P less than 0.01). A preliminary
  electrophysiological (EMG) study of sphincter activity suggested that the obstruction
  to the flow of urine was at least in part due to failure of the external sphincter
  to relax during micturition. Although the total number of cases in this series was
  small the study showed that prostatitis was associated with a disorder of micturition
  which correlated with the other clinical features of the disease and could be objectively
  evaluated. Eradication of infection restored normal conditions in the lower urinary
  tract.
