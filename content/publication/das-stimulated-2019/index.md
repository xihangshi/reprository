abstract: We report on a novel way of performing stimulated electron energy-loss and
  energy-gain spectroscopy (sEELS/sEEGS) experiments that does not require a pulsed
  gun. In this scheme, a regular scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM)
  equipped with a conventional continuous electron gun is fitted with a modified EELS
  detector and a light injector in the object chamber. The modification of the EELS
  detector allows one to expose the EELS camera during tunable time intervals that
  can be synchronized with nanosecond laser pulses hitting the sample, therefore allowing
  us to collect only those electrons that have interacted with the sample under light
  irradiation. Using ∼ 5 ns laser pulses of ∼ 2 eV photon energy on various plasmonic
  silver samples, we obtain evidence of sEELS/sEEGS through the emergence of up to
  two loss and gain peaks in the spectra at ± 2 and ± 4 eV. Because this approach
  does not involve any modification of the gun, our method retains the original performances
  of the microscope in terms of energy resolution and spectral imaging with and without
  light injection. Compared to pulsed-gun techniques, our method is mainly limited
  to a perturbative regime (typically no more that one gain event per incident electron),
  which allows us to observe resonant effects, in particular when the plasmon energy
  of a silver nanostructure matches the laser photon energy. In this situation, EELS
  and EEGS signals are enhanced in proportion to n+1 and n, respectively, where n
  is the average plasmon population due to the external illumination. The n term is
  associated with stimulated loss and gain processes, and the term of 1 corresponds
  to conventional (spontaneous) loss. The EELS part of the spectrum is therefore an
  incoherent superposition of spontaneous and stimulated EEL events. This is confirmed
  by a proper quantum-mechanical description of the electron/light/plasmon system
  incorporating light–plasmon and plasmon–electron interactions, as well as inelastic
  plasmon decay.
