abstract: The primary interactions of low-energy x-rays within condensed matter, viz.
  photoabsorption and coherent scattering, have been described for photon energies
  outside the absorption threshold regions by using atomic scattering factors. The
  atomic scattering factors may be accurately determined from the atomic photoabsorption
  cross sections using modified Kramers-Kronig dispersion relations. From a synthesis
  of the currently available experimental data and recent theoretical calculations
  for photoabsorption, the angle-independent, forward-scattering components of the
  atomic scattering factors have been thus semiempirically determined and tabulated
  here for 92 elements and for the region 50-30,000 eV. Atomic scattering factors
  for all angles of coherent scattering and at the higher photon energies are obtained
  from these tabulated forward-scattering values by adding a simple angle-dependent
  form-factor correction. The incoherent scattering contributions that become significant
  for the light elements at the higher photon energies are similarly determined. The
  basic x-ray interaction relations that are used in applied x-ray physics are presented
  here in terms of the atomic scattering factors. The bulk optical constants are also
  related to the atomic scattering factors. These atomic and optical relations are
  applied to the detailed calculation of the reflectivity characteristics of a series
  of practical x-ray mirror, multilayer, and crystal monochromators. Comparisons of
  the results of this semiempirical, \"atomic-like\" description of x-ray interactions
  for the low-energy region with those of experiment and ab initio theory are presented.
