abstract: Cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), wherein a quantum emitter is coupled
  to electromagnetic cavity modes, is a powerful platform for implementing quantum
  sensors, memories, and networks. However, due to the fundamental tradeoff between
  gate fidelity and execution time, as well as limited scalability, the use of cavity-QED
  for quantum computation was overtaken by other architectures. Here, we introduce
  a new element into cavity-QED â€“ a free charged particle, acting as a flying qubit.
  Using free electrons as a specific example, we demonstrate that our approach enables
  ultrafast, deterministic and universal discrete-variable quantum computation in
  a cavity-QED-based architecture, with potentially improved scalability. Our proposal
  hinges on a novel excitation blockade mechanism in a resonant interaction between
  a free-electron and a cavity polariton. This nonlinear interaction is faster by
  several orders of magnitude with respect to current photon-based cavity-QED gates,
  enjoys wide tunability and can demonstrate fidelities close to unity. Furthermore,
  our scheme is ubiquitous to any cavity nonlinearity, either due to light-matter
  coupling as in the Jaynes-Cummings model or due to photon-photon interactions as
  in a Kerr-type many-body system. In addition to promising advancements in cavity-QED
  quantum computation, our approach paves the way towards ultrafast and deterministic
  generation of highly-entangled photonic graph states and is applicable to other
  quantum technologies involving cavity-QED.
