 abstract = {Owing to the depth to which hard X-rays penetrate into most materials, it is commonly accepted that the only way to realize hard-X-ray mirrors with near 100% reflectance is under conditions of total external reflection at grazing incidence to a surface. At angles away from grazing incidence, substantial reflectance of hard X-rays occurs only as a result of constructive interference of the waves scattered from periodically ordered atomic planes in crystals (Bragg diffraction). Theory predicts that even at normal incidence the reflection of X-rays from diamond under the Bragg condition should approach 100%substantially higher than from any other crystal. Here we demonstrate that commercially produced synthetic diamond crystals do indeed show an unprecedented reflecting power at normal incidence and millielectronvolt-narrow reflection bandwidths for hard X-rays. Bragg diffraction measurements of reflectivity and the energy bandwidth show remarkable agreement with theory. Such properties are valuable to the development of hard-X-ray optics, and could greatly assist the realization of fully coherent X-ray sources, such as X-ray free-electron laser oscillators.
