abstract: 'In the quantum regime of the free-electron laser, the dynamics of the electrons
  is not governed by continuous trajectories but by discrete jumps in momentum. In
  this article, we rederive the two crucial conditions to enter this quantum regime:
  (1) a large quantum mechanical recoil of the electron caused by the scattering with
  the laser and the wiggler field and (2) a small energy spread of the electron beam.
  In contrast to our recent approach based on nonrelativistic quantum mechanics in
  a co-moving frame of reference, we now pursue a model in the laboratory frame employing
  relativistic quantum electrodynamics.'
