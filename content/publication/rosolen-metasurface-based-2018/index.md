abstract: Abstract Metasurfaces are subwavelength spatial variations in geometry and
  material where the structures are of negligible thickness compared to the wavelength
  of light and are optimized for far-field applications, such as controlling the wavefronts
  of electromagnetic waves. Here, we investigate the potential of the metasurface
  near-field profile, generated by an incident few-cycle pulse laser, to facilitate
  the generation of high-frequency light from free electrons. In particular, the metasurface
  near-field contains higher-order spatial harmonics that can be leveraged to generate
  multiple higher-harmonic X-ray frequency peaks. We show that the X-ray spectral
  profile can be arbitrarily shaped by controlling the metasurface geometry, the electron
  energy, and the incidence angle of the laser input. Using ab initio simulations,
  we predict bright and monoenergetic X-rays, achieving energies of 30 keV (with harmonics
  spaced by 3 keV) from 5-MeV electrons using 3.4-eV plasmon polaritons on a metasurface
  with a period of 85 nm. As an example, we present the design of a four-color X-ray
  source, a potential candidate for tabletop multicolor hard X-ray spectroscopy. Our
  developments could help pave the way for compact multi-harmonic sources of high-energy
  photons, which have potential applications in industry, medicine, and the fundamental
  sciences.
