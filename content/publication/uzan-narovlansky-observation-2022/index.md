abstract: Abstract  Intense light–matter interactions have revolutionized our ability
  to probe and manipulate quantum systems at sub-femtosecond timescales 1 , opening
  routes to the all-optical control of electronic currents in solids at petahertz
  rates 2–7 . Such control typically requires electric-field amplitudes in the range
  of almost volts per angstrom, when the voltage drop across a lattice site becomes
  comparable to the characteristic bandgap energies. In this regime, intense light–matter
  interaction induces notable modifications to the electronic and optical properties
  8–10 , dramatically modifying the crystal band structure. Yet, identifying and characterizing
  such modifications remain an outstanding problem. As the oscillating electric field
  changes within the driving field’s cycle, does the band structure follow and how
  can it be defined? Here we address this fundamental question, proposing all-optical
  spectroscopy to probe the laser-induced closing of the bandgap between adjacent
  conduction bands. Our work reveals the link between nonlinear light–matter interactions
  in strongly driven crystals and the sub-cycle modifications in their effective band
  structure.
