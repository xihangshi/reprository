 abstract = {We investigate the acceleration dynamics of quasi-diffraction-free Airy beams in both one- and two-dimensional configurations. We show that this class of finite energy waves can retain their intensity features over several diffraction lengths. The possibility of other physical realizations involving spatiotemporal Airy wave packets is also considered.},
