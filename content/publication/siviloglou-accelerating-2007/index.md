abstract: We investigate the acceleration dynamics of quasi-diffraction-free Airy
  beams in both one- and two-dimensional configurations. We show that this class of
  finite energy waves can retain their intensity features over several diffraction
  lengths. The possibility of other physical realizations involving spatiotemporal
  Airy wave packets is also considered.
