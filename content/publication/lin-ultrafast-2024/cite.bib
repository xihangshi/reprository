 abstract = {Similar to the optical diffraction of light passing through a material grating, the Kapitza-Dirac effect occurs when an electron is diffracted by a standing light wave. In its original description, the effect is time independent. Here, we extended the Kapitza-Dirac effect to the time domain. By tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of a pulsed electron wave packet diffracted by a 60-femtosecond (where one femtosecond = 10
−15
seconds) standing wave pulse in a pump-probe scheme, we observed time-dependent diffraction patterns. The fringe spacing in the observed pattern differs from that generated by the conventional Kapitza-Dirac effect. By exploiting this time-resolved diffraction scheme, we can access the time evolution of the phase properties of a free electron and potentially image ionic potentials and electronic decoherences.

Editor’s summary

Diffraction of light from a matter grating stems from the wave property of electromagnetic radiation. Likewise, the wave properties of electrons prompted the proposal from Kapitza and Dirac in 1933 that electrons should be diffracted from a strong standing wave of light. Using an intense pulsed standing wave, Lin
et al
. added a temporal dimension when probing the evolution of a photoelectron wavepacket. Such phase sensitivity of the demonstrated dynamical Kapitza-Dirac effect should provide a valuable tool for ultrafast electron spectroscopy studies. —Ian S. Osborne
