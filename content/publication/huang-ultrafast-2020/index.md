abstract: For applications in ultrafast communication, all-optical switches will require
  low energy consumption, high speed, a strong modulation ratio, a small footprint,
  and on-chip integration. Although the small footprint and on-chip integration are
  accessible, the trade-off between low energy consumption and high speed has been
  challenging. Huang et al. exploited the idea of bound states in the continuum, effectively
  a high–quality (Q) cavity without the physical cavity, to design vortex lasers with
  highly directional output and single-mode operation. With the trade-off between
  low energy consumption and high speed now broken, it should be possible to realize
  ultrafast optical switching that meets all the requirements of modern classic and
  quantum information.Science, this issue p. 1018The development of classical and
  quantum information–processing technology calls for on-chip integrated sources of
  structured light. Although integrated vortex microlasers have been previously demonstrated,
  they remain static and possess relatively high lasing thresholds, making them unsuitable
  for high-speed optical communication and computing. We introduce perovskite-based
  vortex microlasers and demonstrate their application to ultrafast all-optical switching
  at room temperature. By exploiting both mode symmetry and far-field properties,
  we reveal that the vortex beam lasing can be switched to linearly polarized beam
  lasing, or vice versa, with switching times of 1 to 1.5 picoseconds and energy consumption
  that is orders of magnitude lower than in previously demonstrated all-optical switching.
  Our results provide an approach that breaks the long-standing trade-off between
  low energy consumption and high-speed nanophotonics, introducing vortex microlasers
  that are switchable at terahertz frequencies.
