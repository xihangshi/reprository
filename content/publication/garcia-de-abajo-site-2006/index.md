abstract: A powerful analytical approach is followed to study light transmission through
  subwavelength holes drilled in thick perfect-conductor films, showing that full
  transmission (100%) is attainable in arrays of arbitrarily narrow holes as compared
  to the film thickness. The interplay between resonances localized in individual
  holes and lattice resonances originating in the array periodicity reveals new mechanisms
  of transmission enhancement and suppression. In particular, localized resonances
  obtained by filling the holes with high-index-of-refraction material are examined
  and experimentally observed through large enhancement in the transmission of individual
  holes.
