 abstract = {A powerful analytical approach is followed to study light transmission through subwavelength holes drilled in thick perfect-conductor films, showing that full transmission (100%) is attainable in arrays of arbitrarily narrow holes as compared to the film thickness. The interplay between resonances localized in individual holes and lattice resonances originating in the array periodicity reveals new mechanisms of transmission enhancement and suppression. In particular, localized resonances obtained by filling the holes with high-index-of-refraction material are examined and experimentally observed through large enhancement in the transmission of individual holes.},
