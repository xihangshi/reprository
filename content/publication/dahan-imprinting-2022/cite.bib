 abstract = {We know that light is both a wave and a particle, and this duality arises from the classical and quantum nature of electromagnetic excitations. Dahan et al. observed that all experiments to date in which light interacts with free electrons have been described with light considered as a wave (see the Perspective by Carbone). The authors present experimental evidence revealing the quantum nature of the interaction between photons and free electrons. They combine an ultrafast transmission electron microscope with a silicon-photonic nanostructure that confines and strengthens the interaction between the light and the electrons. The ?quantum? statistics of the photons are imprints onto the propagating electrons and are seen directly in their energy spectrum. ?ISO The quantum nature of light?matter interactions is revealed by ultrafast transmission electron microscopy. The interaction between free electrons and light stands at the base of both classical and quantum physics, with applications in free-electron acceleration, radiation sources, and electron microscopy. Yet to this day, all experiments involving free-electron?light interactions are fully explained by describing the light as a classical wave. We observed quantum statistics effects of photons on free-electron?light interactions. We demonstrate interactions that pass continuously from Poissonian to super-Poissonian and up to thermal statistics, revealing a transition from quantum walk to classical random walk on the free-electron energy ladder. The electron walker serves as the probe in nondestructive quantum detection, measuring the second-order photon-correlation g(2)(0) and higher-orders g(n)(0). Unlike conventional quantum-optical detectors, the electron can perform both quantum weak measurements and projective measurements by evolving into an entangled joint state with the photons. These findings inspire hitherto inaccessible concepts in quantum optics, including free-electron?based ultrafast quantum tomography of light.},
