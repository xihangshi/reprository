abstract: Quantum Theory of Near-field Electrodynamics gives a self-contained account
  of the fundamental theory of field-matter interaction on a subwavelength scale.
  The quantum physical behavior of matter (atoms and mesoscopic media) in both classical
  and quantum fields is treated. The role of local-field effects and nonlocal electrodynamics,
  and the tight links to the theory of spatial photon localization are emphasized.
  The book may serve as a reference work in the field, and is of general interest
  for physicists working in quantum optics, mesoscopic electrodynamics and physical
  optics. The macroscopic and microscopic classical theories form a good starting
  point for the quantum approach, and these theories are presented in a manner appropriate
  for graduate students entering near-field optics. pt. 1. Microscopic classical theory
