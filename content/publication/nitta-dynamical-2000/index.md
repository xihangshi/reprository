abstract: 'There are two models which describe the origin of \"parametric x-ray radiation\"
  (PXR): the dynamical (\"quasi-ÄŒerenkov\") model and the kinematical model. A theory
  is developed that unifies the two models. An analytic expression is obtained which
  gives a certain dynamical effect at high energies while reduced to the kinematical
  formula at low energies. A Green function analysis cleary shows that dynamical effect
  is not essential for the description of PXR.'
