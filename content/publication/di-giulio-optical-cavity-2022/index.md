abstract: Abstract  The generation of nonclassical light states bears a paramount
  importance in quantum optics and is largely relying on the interaction between intense
  laser pulses and nonlinear media. Recently, electron beams, such as those used in
  ultrafast electron microscopy to retrieve information from a specimen, have been
  proposed as a tool to manipulate both bright and dark confined optical excitations,
  inducing semiclassical states of light that range from coherent to thermal mixtures.
  Here, we show that the ponderomotive contribution to the electron–cavity interaction,
  which we argue to be significant for low-energy electrons subject to strongly confined
  near-fields, can actually create a more general set of optical states, including
  coherent and squeezed states. The postinteraction electron spectrum further reveals
  signatures of the nontrivial role played by A 2 terms in the light–matter coupling
  Hamiltonian, particularly when the cavity is previously excited by either chaotic
  or coherent illumination. Our work introduces a disruptive approach to the creation
  of nontrivial quantum cavity states for quantum information and optics applications,
  while it suggests unexplored possibilities for electron beam shaping.
