 abstract = {This paper presents an investigation of the reconstructibility of coherent X-ray diffractive imaging diffraction patterns for a class of binary random `bitmap' objects. Combining analytical results and numerical simulations, the critical fluence per bitmap pixel is determined, for arbitrary contrast values (absorption level and phase shift), both for the optical near- and far-field. This work extends previous investigations based on information theory, enabling a comparison of the amount of information carried by single photons in different diffraction regimes. The experimental results show an order-of-magnitude agreement.},
