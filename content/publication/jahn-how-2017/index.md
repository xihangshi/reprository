abstract: This paper presents an investigation of the reconstructibility of coherent
  X-ray diffractive imaging diffraction patterns for a class of binary random `bitmap'
  objects. Combining analytical results and numerical simulations, the critical fluence
  per bitmap pixel is determined, for arbitrary contrast values (absorption level
  and phase shift), both for the optical near- and far-field. This work extends previous
  investigations based on information theory, enabling a comparison of the amount
  of information carried by single photons in different diffraction regimes. The experimental
  results show an order-of-magnitude agreement.
