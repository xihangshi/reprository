abstract: A formulation for the characterization of superradiant and stimulated-superradiant
  radiative emission from bunched electron beams is presented. The radiation is characterized
  in terms of power and spectral power per radiation mode, which provide a measure
  of the useful spatially coherent radiation power and spectral power emitted by a
  radiation source. When the bunched electron beam emits superradiantly, these parameters
  scale like the square of the number of electrons, orders of magnitude more than
  spontaneous emission. The formulation applies to emission from single bunches, a
  finite number of bunches in a macropulse, or periodic bunching. It can be employed
  on any kind of e-beam radiation scheme. Specific analytic expressions are derived
  for coherent synchrotron radiation and prebunched free-electron laser, providing
  a basis for comparing and understanding their connection. Â© 2005 The American Physical
