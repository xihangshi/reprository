 abstract = {Algorithms based on the method of moments (MOM) and the coupled dipole method (CDM) are commonly used to solve electromagnetic scattering problems. In this paper, the strong and the weak forms of both numerical techniques are derived for bianisotropic scatterers. The two techniques are shown to be fully equivalent to each other, thereby defusing claims of superiority often made for the charms of one technique over the other. In the final section, reductions of the algorithms for isotropic dielectric scatterers are explicitly given.},
