 abstract = {The detailed theory of parametric X-rays from charged particles in a crystal is considered. It is shown that this radiation is due to the diffraction of the particle's electromagnetic field. Some features of the parametric X-rays allow us to separate this radiation from other radiation types. Methods of the experimental investigation and uses of parametric X-rays are discussed.},
