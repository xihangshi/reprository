abstract: The detailed theory of parametric X-rays from charged particles in a crystal
  is considered. It is shown that this radiation is due to the diffraction of the
  particle's electromagnetic field. Some features of the parametric X-rays allow us
  to separate this radiation from other radiation types. Methods of the experimental
  investigation and uses of parametric X-rays are discussed.
