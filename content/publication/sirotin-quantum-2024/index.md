abstract: Quantum states of light play a key role in modern quantum science, but creating
  hybrid quantum light-matter states remains a challenge. A promising basis for the
  creation of hybrid states is the interaction of free electrons with photons, which
  has so far been largely implemented without taking into account electron quantum
  recoil effects. We provide an analytical quantum electrodynamics-based framework
  for quantum optics with recoiled electrons and introduce a single recoil parameter
  $sigma$. With this framework, we show how to generate photon and electron-photon
  Bell, Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) and NOON states, coherent states, squeezed
  vacuum (including bright squeezed vacuum) and twin beams. We analyze the transition
  between these states and predict a new class of photon and electron-photon quantum
  states shaped with the photon recoil effect (recoil-induced shaping). These results
  have wide potential applications including quantum computing and communication with
  photons and free electrons, and open up a novel avenue for ultrafast electron microscopy
  and next-generation free-electron sources.
