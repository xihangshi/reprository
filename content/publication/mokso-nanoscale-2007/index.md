abstract: To overcome the limitations in terms of spatial resolution and field of
  view of existing tomography techniques, a hard x-ray projection microscope is realized
  based on the sub-100-nm focus produced by Kirkpatrick-Baez optics. The sample is
  set at a small distance downstream of the focus and Fresnel diffraction patterns
  with variable magnification are recorded on a medium-resolution detector. While
  the approach requires a specific phase retrieval procedure and correction for mirror
  imperfections, it allows zooming nondestructively into bulky samples. Quantitative
  three-dimensional nanoscale microscopy is demonstrated on an aluminum alloy in local
  tomography mode.
