abstract: 'Many animals have evolved adept sensory systems that enable dexterous mobility
  in complex environments. Echolocating bats hunting in dense vegetation represent
  an extreme case of this, where all necessary information about the environment must
  pass through a parsimonious channel of pulsed, 1D echo signals. We have investigated
  whether certain bats (rhinolophids and hipposiderids) actively create Doppler shifts
  with their pinnae to encode additional sensory information. Our results show that
  the bats’ active pinna motions are a source of Doppler shifts that have all attributes
  required for a functional relevance: (i) the Doppler shifts produced were several
  times larger than the reported perception threshold; (ii) the motions of the fastest
  moving pinna portions were oriented to maximize the Doppler shifts for echoes returning
  from the emission direction, indicating a possible evolutionary optimization; (iii)
  pinna motions coincided with echo reception; (iv) Doppler-shifted signals from the
  fast-moving pinna portion entered the ear canal of a biomimetic pinna model; and
  (v) the time-frequency Doppler shift signatures were found to encode target direction
  in an orderly fashion. These results indicate that instead of avoiding or suppressing
  all self-produced Doppler shifts, rhinolophid and hipposiderid bats actively create
  Doppler shifts with their own pinnae. These bats could hence make use of a previously
  unknown nonlinear mechanism for the encoding of sensory information, based on Doppler
  signatures. Such a mechanism could be a source for the discovery of sensing principles
  not only in sensory physiology but also in the engineering of sensory systems.'
