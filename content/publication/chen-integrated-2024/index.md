abstract: The exploration of physical degrees of freedom of light with infinite dimensionality,
  such as orbital angular momentum (OAM) and frequency, has profoundly reshaped the
  landscape of modern optics, with representative photonic functional devices including
  optical vortex emitters and frequency combs. In nanophotonics, whispering gallery
  mode microresonators naturally support applications based on the OAM of light and
  have been employed as on-chip emitters of monochromatic optical vortices. On the
  other hand, whispering gallery mode microresonators can serve as a highly efficient
  non-linear optical platform for producing light at different frequencies, that is,
  microcombs. Here we combine optical vortices and microcombs by demonstrating an
  optical vortex comb on a III–V integrated non-linear ring microresonator. The angular
  grating-dressed non-linear microring simultaneously emits spatiotemporal light springs
  consisting of 50 OAM modes, with each frequency of the microcomb carrying a distinct
  OAM value. We also experimentally generate optical pulses with time-varying OAM
  by carefully endowing the spatiotemporal light springs with a specific intermodal
  phase relation. We expect our work to favour the development of integrated non-linear
  and quantum photonics for exploring fundamental optical physics and advancing photonic
  quantum technology.
