abstract: Abstract High-order harmonics in the extreme-ultraviolet spectral range,
  resulting from the strong-field laser-atom interaction, have been used in a broad
  range of fascinating applications in all states of matter. In the majority of these
  studies the harmonic generation process is described using semi-classical theories
  which treat the electromagnetic field of the driving laser pulse classically without
  taking into account its quantum nature. In addition, for the measurement of the
  generated harmonics, all the experiments require diagnostics in the extreme-ultraviolet
  spectral region. Here by treating the driving laser field quantum mechanically we
  reveal the quantum-optical nature of the high-order harmonic generation process
  by measuring the photon number distribution of the infrared light exiting the harmonic
  generation medium. It is found that the high-order harmonics are imprinted in the
  photon number distribution of the infrared light and can be recorded without the
  need of a spectrometer in the extreme-ultraviolet.
