abstract: Mg rechargeable batteries (MgRBs) represent a safe and high-energy battery
  technology but suffer from the lack of suitable cathode materials due to the slow
  solid-state diffusion of the highly polarizing divalent Mg ion. Previous methods
  improve performance at the cost of incompatibility with anode/electrolyte and drastic
  decrease in volumetric energy density. Herein we report interlayer expansion as
  a general and effective atomic-level lattice engineering approach to transform inactive
  intercalation hosts into efficient Mg storage materials without introducing adverse
  side effects. As a proof-of-concept we have combined theory, synthesis, electrochemical
  measurement, and kinetic analysis to improve Mg diffusion behavior in MoS2, which
  is a poor Mg transporting material in its pristine form. First-principles simulations
  suggest that expanded interlayer spacing allows for fast Mg diffusion because of
  weakened Mg-host interactions. Experimentally, the expansion was realized by inserting
  a controlled amount of poly(ethylene oxide) into the lattice of MoS2 to increase
  the interlayer distance from 0.62 nm to up to 1.45 nm. The expansion boosts Mg diffusivity
  by 2 orders of magnitude, effectively enabling the otherwise barely active MoS2
  to approach its theoretical storage capacity as well as to achieve one of the highest
  rate capabilities among Mg-intercalation materials. The interlayer expansion approach
  can be leveraged to a wide range of host materials for the storage of various ions,
  leading to novel intercalation chemistry and opening up new opportunities for the
  development of advanced materials for next-generation energy storage.
