 abstract = {The demand for improved electronic and optoelectronic devices has fuelled the development of epitaxial growth techniques for single-crystalline semiconductors. However, lattice and thermal expansion coefficient mismatch problems limit the options for growth and integration of high-efficiency electronic and photonic devices on dissimilar materials. Accordingly, advanced epitaxial growth and layer lift-off techniques have been developed to address issues relating to lattice mismatch. Here, we review epitaxial growth and layer-transfer techniques for monolithic integration of dissimilar single-crystalline materials for application in advanced electronic and photonic devices. We also examine emerging epitaxial growth techniques that involve two-dimensional materials as an epitaxial release layer and explore future integrated computing systems that could harness both advanced epitaxial growth and lift-off approaches.},
