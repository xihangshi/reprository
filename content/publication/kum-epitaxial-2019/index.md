abstract: The demand for improved electronic and optoelectronic devices has fuelled
  the development of epitaxial growth techniques for single-crystalline semiconductors.
  However, lattice and thermal expansion coefficient mismatch problems limit the options
  for growth and integration of high-efficiency electronic and photonic devices on
  dissimilar materials. Accordingly, advanced epitaxial growth and layer lift-off
  techniques have been developed to address issues relating to lattice mismatch. Here,
  we review epitaxial growth and layer-transfer techniques for monolithic integration
  of dissimilar single-crystalline materials for application in advanced electronic
  and photonic devices. We also examine emerging epitaxial growth techniques that
  involve two-dimensional materials as an epitaxial release layer and explore future
  integrated computing systems that could harness both advanced epitaxial growth and
  lift-off approaches.
