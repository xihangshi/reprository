abstract: Coherent control of quantum dynamics is key to a multitude of fundamental
  studies and applications1. In the visible or longer-wavelength domains, near-resonant
  light fields have become the primary tool with which to control electron dynamics2.
  Recently, coherent control in the extreme-ultraviolet range was demonstrated3, with
  a few-attosecond temporal resolution of the phase control. At hard-X-ray energies
  (above 5–10 kiloelectronvolts), Mössbauer nuclei feature narrow nuclear resonances
  due to their recoilless absorption and emission of light, and spectroscopy of these
  resonances is widely used to study the magnetic, structural and dynamical properties
  of matter4,5. It has been shown that the power and scope of Mössbauer spectroscopy
  can be greatly improved using various control techniques6–16. However, coherent
  control of atomic nuclei using suitably shaped near-resonant X-ray fields remains
  an open challenge. Here we demonstrate such control, and use the tunable phase between
  two X-ray pulses to switch the nuclear exciton dynamics between coherent enhanced
  excitation and coherent enhanced emission. We present a method of shaping single
  pulses delivered by state-of-the-art X-ray facilities into tunable double pulses,
  and demonstrate a temporal stability of the phase control on the few-zeptosecond
  timescale. Our results unlock coherent optical control for nuclei, and pave the
  way for nuclear Ramsey spectroscopy17 and spin-echo-like techniques, which should
  not only advance nuclear quantum optics18, but also help to realize X-ray clocks
  and frequency standards19. In the long term, we envision time-resolved studies of
  nuclear out-of-equilibrium dynamics, which is a long-standing challenge in Mössbauer
  science20. Suitably shaped X-ray pulses are used to coherently steer the quantum
  dynamics of atoms’ nuclei rather than their electrons, with few-zeptosecond temporal
  stability of the phase control.
