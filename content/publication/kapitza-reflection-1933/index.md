abstract: It is well known that a beam of light falling on a reflecting mirror forms
  standing waves. This effect has been very beautifully made use of in Lippmann's
  colour photography process. The standing light waves, in this case, produce a periodic
  effect in the emulsion of the photographic plate which, when developed, scatters
  light and produces a similar colour effect. Instead of using a beam of light, it
  would seem possible to scatter electrons from the emulsion and obtain a reflection
  of electrons similar to that of a space grating. But it seemed to us that it would
  be of much greater interest to consider an experiment in which electrons are reflected
  from the standing waves of light. The direct scattering of free electronic waves
  by light has strictly never been observed, and it was thought possible that by this
  method, owing to the interference of the electrons and to the fact that the scattered
  electrons are focussed to one spot, the magnification of the phenomenon would be
  sufficient to make it observable. From the theory developed below, it will be seen
  that the experiment is just on the verge of possibility, and would be very difficult
  to carry out. The main interest of the experiment would come from the possibility
  of observing stimulated scattered radiation which up to the present has never been
  verified experimentally.
