abstract: Computational ghost imaging, in which an image is retrieved from a known
  patterned field that illuminates an object and the total transmitted intensity therefrom,
  has seen great advances on account of its advantages and potential applications
  at all wavelengths. However, even though lensless x-ray ghost imaging was anticipated
  more than a decade ago, its development has been hampered due to the lack of suitable
  optics. The image quality is proportional to the total flux in conventional projection
  x-ray imaging, but high photon energy could severely damage the object being imaged,
  so decreasing the radiation dose while maintaining image quality is a fundamental
  problem. Using a simple tabletop x-ray source, we have successfully realized ghost
  imaging of planar and natural objects with a much higher contrast-to-noise ratio
  compared to projection x-ray imaging at the same low-radiation dose. Ultra-low-flux
  imaging has been achieved, and thus radiation damage of biological specimens could
  be greatly reduced with this new technique.
