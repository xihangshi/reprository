abstract: Silicon is widely used as the material of choice for semiconductor and insulator
  applications in nanoelectronics, micro-electro-mechanical systems, solar cells,
  and on-chip photonics. In stark contrast, in this paper, we explore siliconâ€™s metallic
  properties and show that it can support propagating surface plasmons, collective
  charge oscillations, in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) energy regime not possible
  with other plasmonic materials such as aluminum, silver, or gold. This is fundamentally
  different from conventional approaches, where doping semiconductors is considered
  necessary to observe plasmonic behavior. We experimentally map the photonic band
  structure of EUV surface and bulk plasmons in silicon using momentum-resolved electron
  energy loss spectroscopy. Our experimental observations are validated by macroscopic
  electrodynamic electron energy loss theory simulations as well as quantum density
  functional theory calculations. As an example of exploiting these EUV plasmons for
  applications, we propose a tunable and broadband thresholdless Cherenkov radiation
  source in the EUV using silicon plasmonic metamaterials. Our work can pave the way
  for the field of EUV plasmonics.
