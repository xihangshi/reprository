abstract: Incoherent bremsstrahlung by high-energy particles in crystal is due to
  the thermal spread of atoms in relation to their equilibrium positions in the lattice.
  The simulation procedure developed earlier for the incoherent radiation is applied
  to the case of the electrons and positrons motion in the sinusoidally bent crystal.
  The results of simulation are in agreement with the data of recent experiments carried
  out at the Mainz Microtron MAMI. The possibility of use of the sinusoidally bent
  crystals as undulators is discussed.
