abstract: X ray radiography and tomography are important tools in medicine as well
  as in life science and materials science. Not long ago an approach called in-line
  holography based on simple propagation became possible using partially coherent
  synchrotron beams like the ones available at the European Synchrotron Radiation
  Facility (ESRF). Theoretical and experimental work by Cloetens et al. [Appl. Phys.
  Lett 75, 2912 (1999)] have shown that quantitative retrieval of the optical phase,
  from a set of radiographs taken at different sample-to-detector distances, is feasible.
  Mathematically speaking we are dealing with a direct method based on linearization
  in order to solve an inverse nonlinear problem. The phase retrieval can be combined
  with classical tomography in order to obtain a three-dimensional representation
  of the objectâ€™s electron density (holotomography). In order to optimize the image
  contrast for the numerical phase retrieval process, we have carried out calculations
  resulting in an optimized choice of value and number of the sample-to-detector distances
  as well as of the photon energy. These results were then confirmed by experiments
  on the ESRF long beamline ID19.
