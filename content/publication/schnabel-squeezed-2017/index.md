abstract: According to quantum theory the energy exchange between physical systems
  is quantized. As a direct consequence, measurement sensitivities are fundamentally
  limited by quantization noise, or just ‘quantum noise’ in short. Furthermore, Heisenberg’s
  Uncertainty Principle demands measurement back-action for some observables of a
  system if they are measured repeatedly. In both respects, squeezed states are of
  high interest since they show a ‘squeezed’ uncertainty, which can be used to improve
  the sensitivity of measurement devices beyond the usual quantum noise limits including
  those impacted by quantum back-action noise. Squeezed states of light can be produced
  with nonlinear optics, and a large variety of proof-of-principle experiments were
  performed in past decades. As an actual application, squeezed light has now been
  used for several years to improve the measurement sensitivity of GEO 600 – a laser
  interferometer built for the detection of gravitational waves. Given this success,
  squeezed light is likely to significantly contribute to the new field of gravitational-wave
  astronomy. This Review revisits the concept of squeezed states and two-mode squeezed
  states of light, with a focus on experimental observations. The distinct properties
  of squeezed states displayed in quadrature phase-space as well as in the photon
  number representation are described. The role of the light’s quantum noise in laser
  interferometers is summarized and the actual application of squeezed states in these
  measurement devices is reviewed.
