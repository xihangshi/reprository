 abstract = {According to quantum theory the energy exchange between physical systems is quantized. As a direct consequence, measurement sensitivities are fundamentally limited by quantization noise, or just ‘quantum noise’ in short. Furthermore, Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle demands measurement back-action for some observables of a system if they are measured repeatedly. In both respects, squeezed states are of high interest since they show a ‘squeezed’ uncertainty, which can be used to improve the sensitivity of measurement devices beyond the usual quantum noise limits including those impacted by quantum back-action noise. Squeezed states of light can be produced with nonlinear optics, and a large variety of proof-of-principle experiments were performed in past decades. As an actual application, squeezed light has now been used for several years to improve the measurement sensitivity of GEO 600 – a laser interferometer built for the detection of gravitational waves. Given this success, squeezed light is likely to significantly contribute to the new field of gravitational-wave astronomy. This Review revisits the concept of squeezed states and two-mode squeezed states of light, with a focus on experimental observations. The distinct properties of squeezed states displayed in quadrature phase-space as well as in the photon number representation are described. The role of the light’s quantum noise in laser interferometers is summarized and the actual application of squeezed states in these measurement devices is reviewed.},
