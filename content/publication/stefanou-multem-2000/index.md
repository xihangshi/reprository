abstract: We present a new version of a program for the calculation of the frequency
  band structure of an infinite photonic crystal, and of the transmission, reflection
  and absorption coefficients of light by a slab of this crystal. The crystal consists
  of a stack of identical slices parallel to a given surface; a slice may consist
  of a number of different components, each of which can be either a homogeneous plate
  or a multilayer of non-overlapping spherical particles of given periodicity parallel
  to the surface. The homogeneous media to the left and right of the slab may be different
  (have different real and positive dielectric functions and magnetic permeabilities).
