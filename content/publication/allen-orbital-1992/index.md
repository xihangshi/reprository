abstract: Laser light with a Laguerre-Gaussian amplitude distribution is found to
  have a well-defined orbital angular momentum. An astigmatic optical system may be
  used to transform a high-order Laguerre-Gaussian mode into a high-order Hermite-Gaussian
  mode reversibly. An experiment is proposed to measure the mechanical torque induced
  by the transfer of orbital angular momentum associated with such a transformation.
