abstract: X-ray crystallography has been central to the development of many fields
  of science over the past century. It has now matured to a point that as long as
  good-quality crystals are available, their atomic structure can be routinely determined
  in three dimensions. However, many samples in physics, chemistry, materials science,
  nanoscience, geology, and biology are noncrystalline, and thus their three-dimensional
  structures are not accessible by traditional x-ray crystallography. Overcoming this
  hurdle has required the development of new coherent imagingmethods to harness new
  coherent x-ray light sources. Here we review the revolutionary advances that are
  transforming x-ray sources and imaging in the 21st century.
