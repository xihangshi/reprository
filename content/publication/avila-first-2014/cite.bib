 abstract = {During the last few decades, many scientific research areas have experienced remarkable progress in nanoscience and nanotechnology. In an even rather wider field, complex and smart materials are also often isolated as small crystallites, and they present serious difficulties in terms of being synthesized without fluctuations of their compositions or crystalline orientations. This particular interest in material characterization at rather small scales has considerably affected the design, manufacturing, and performance of advanced scientific instruments. In fact, when characterizing advanced materials, progress frequently refers to a new area of knowledge, to the need of seeing, measuring, and understanding objects at the nano- and mesoscopic scale. © Copyright Taylor & Francis.},
