abstract: During the last few decades, many scientific research areas have experienced
  remarkable progress in nanoscience and nanotechnology. In an even rather wider field,
  complex and smart materials are also often isolated as small crystallites, and they
  present serious difficulties in terms of being synthesized without fluctuations
  of their compositions or crystalline orientations. This particular interest in material
  characterization at rather small scales has considerably affected the design, manufacturing,
  and performance of advanced scientific instruments. In fact, when characterizing
  advanced materials, progress frequently refers to a new area of knowledge, to the
  need of seeing, measuring, and understanding objects at the nano- and mesoscopic
  scale. © Copyright Taylor & Francis.
