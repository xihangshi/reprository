abstract: 'X-ray scattering is typically used as a weak linear atomic-scale probe
  of matter. At high intensities, such as produced at free-electron lasers, nonlinearities
  can become important, and the probe may no longer be considered weak. Here we report
  the observation of one of the most fundamental nonlinear X-ray–matter interactions:
  the concerted nonlinear Compton scattering of two identical hard X-ray photons producing
  a single higher-energy photon. The X-ray intensity reached 4 × 1020 W cm−2, corresponding
  to an electric field well above the atomic unit of strength and within almost four
  orders of magnitude of the quantum-electrodynamic critical field. We measure a signal
  from solid beryllium that scales quadratically in intensity, consistent with simultaneous
  non-resonant two-photon scattering from nearly-free electrons. The high-energy photons
  show an anomalously large redshift that is incompatible with a free-electron approximation
  for the ground-state electron distribution, suggesting an enhanced nonlinearity
  for scattering at large momentum transfer.'
