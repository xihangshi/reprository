abstract: 'Two-dimensional (2D) materials can confine light to volumes much shorter
  than the wavelength, and, together, the long propagation lengths make them attractive
  materials for developing nanophotonic platforms. Characterizing the spatiotemporal
  control of 2D polariton wave packets has been hindered for the same reasons that
  make their potential applications exciting: They have extremely small wavelengths
  and are strongly confined inside the material. Kurman et al. developed a new pump-probe
  technique based on electron emission that provides access to the spatiotemporal
  dynamics of 2D polaritons. The nanometric spatial resolution and femtosecond temporal
  resolution will be useful for probing the excitation dynamics of these materials.
  Science, abg9015, this issue p. 1181 A pump-probe electron emission technique is
  used image the dynamics of polaritons in 2D materials. Coherent optical excitations
  in two-dimensional (2D) materials, 2D polaritons, can generate a plethora of optical
  phenomena that arise from the extraordinary dispersion relations that do not exist
  in regular materials. Probing of the dynamical phenomena of 2D polaritons requires
  simultaneous spatial and temporal imaging capabilities and could reveal unknown
  coherent optical phenomena in 2D materials. Here, we present a spatiotemporal measurement
  of 2D wave packet dynamics, from its formation to its decay, using an ultrafast
  transmission electron microscope driven by femtosecond midinfrared pulses. The ability
  to coherently excite phonon-polariton wave packets and probe their evolution in
  a nondestructive manner reveals intriguing dispersion-dependent dynamics that includes
  splitting of multibranch wave packets and, unexpectedly, wave packet deceleration
  and acceleration. Having access to the full spatiotemporal dynamics of 2D wave packets
  can be used to illuminate puzzles in topological polaritons and discover exotic
  nonlinear optical phenomena in 2D materials.'
