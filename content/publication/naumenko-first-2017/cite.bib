 abstract = {The conical effect in Smith–Purcell radiation arising from electrons moving at non-zero angle to the direction of grating periodicity has been observed for the first time. It was found that the maximum of radiation intensity for ψ ≠ 0 shifts in both polar and azimuth angles. The experimental and theoretical results were compared, and the good agreement was shown. The experiment has been performed for 6 MeV electrons and at millimeter wavelengths.},
