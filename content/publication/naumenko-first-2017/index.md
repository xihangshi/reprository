abstract: The conical effect in Smith–Purcell radiation arising from electrons moving
  at non-zero angle to the direction of grating periodicity has been observed for
  the first time. It was found that the maximum of radiation intensity for ψ ≠ 0 shifts
  in both polar and azimuth angles. The experimental and theoretical results were
  compared, and the good agreement was shown. The experiment has been performed for
  6 MeV electrons and at millimeter wavelengths.
