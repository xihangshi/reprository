abstract: Strong coupling in light-matter systems is a central concept in cavity quantum
  electrodynamics and is essential for many quantum technologies. Especially in the
  optical range, full control of highly connected multi-qubit systems necessitates
  quantum coherent probes with nanometric spatial resolution, which are currently
  inaccessible. Here, we propose the use of free electrons as high-resolution quantum
  sensors for strongly coupled light-matter systems. Shaping the free-electron wave
  packet enables the measurement of the quantum state of the entire hybrid systems.
  We specifically show how quantum interference of the free-electron wave packet gives
  rise to a quantum-enhanced sensing protocol for the position and dipole orientation
  of a subnanometer emitter inside a cavity. Our results showcase the great versatility
  and applicability of quantum interactions between free electrons and strongly coupled
  cavities, relying on the unique properties of free electrons as strongly interacting
  flying qubits with miniscule dimensions. , Free-electron wavefunctions can be used
  as probes of strong coupling and polaritonic quantum states.
