abstract: We propose free-electron Rabi oscillation by creating an isolated two-level
  system in a synthetic energy space induced by laser. The π/2-pulse and π-pulse in
  synthetic Rabi dynamics can function as 'beam splitters' and 'mirrors' for free-electron
  interferometry, allowing us to detect local electromagnetic fields and plasmonic
  excitations. When the coupling field is quantized, we can observe quantum and vacuum
  Rabi oscillations of the two-level electron, which can be used to investigate the
  quantum statistics of optical excitations and electron-photon entanglement. Recent
  advances in laser control of electron microscopes and spectroscopes makes the experimental
  detection of synthetic Rabi oscillations possible. However, observing the quantum
  Rabi oscillation of electrons remains challenging. Our work has the potential to
  advance various fundamentals and applications of resonant light-matter interactions
  between low-energy electrons and quatum light.
