abstract: Abstract It is well known that optical media create artificial geometry
  for light and curved geometry acts as an effective optical medium. This correspondence
  originates from the form invariance of Maxwell’s equations, which recently has spawned
  a booming field called ‘transformation optics’. Here we investigate responses of
  three transformation media under electromagnetic pulses and find that pulse radiation
  can induce unbalanced net force on transformation media, which will cause translation
  and rotation of transformation media although their final momentum can still be
  zero. Therefore, the transformation media do not necessarily stay the same after
  an electromagnetic wave passes through.
