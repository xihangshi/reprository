abstract: We observed the effect of variation in the radiation angle, which originated
  from electron beam divergence, size, and measurement geometries, on the widths of
  spectral peaks in X-rays produced by single-mode interfered transition radiation
  (SM-ITR). For two different beam conditions, which mainly produced different electron
  beam divergences, we measured the X-ray spectra of SM-ITR from a multilayer target
  which was bombarded by 15-MeV electrons. The experimental results show that the
  width of the spectral peaks is sensitive to a small change in the variations in
  radiation angle. This result means that the control of electron beam divergence
  is very important to the realization of truly fine SM-ITR spectra.
