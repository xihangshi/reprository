abstract: Abstract Plasmonic high-harmonic generation (HHG) drew attention as a means
  of producing coherent extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation by taking advantage of
  field enhancement occurring in metallic nanostructures. Here a metal-sapphire nanostructure
  is devised to provide a solid tip as the HHG emitter, replacing commonly used gaseous
  atoms. The fabricated solid tip is made of monocrystalline sapphire surrounded by
  a gold thin-film layer, and intended to produce EUV harmonics by the inter- and
  intra-band oscillations of electrons driven by the incident laser. The metal-sapphire
  nanostructure enhances the incident laser field by means of surface plasmon polaritons,
  triggering HHG directly from moderate femtosecond pulses of ∼0.1 TW cm −2 intensities.
  The measured EUV spectra exhibit odd-order harmonics up to ∼60 nm wavelengths without
  the plasma atomic lines typically seen when using gaseous atoms as the HHG emitter.
  This experimental outcome confirms that the plasmonic HHG approach is a promising
  way to realize coherent EUV sources for nano-scale near-field applications in spectroscopy,
  microscopy, lithography and atto-second physics.
