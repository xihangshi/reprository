abstract: Bremsstrahlung—the spontaneous emission of broadband radiation from free
  electrons that are deflected by atomic nuclei—contributes to the majority of X-rays
  emitted from X-ray tubes and used in applications ranging from medical imaging to
  semiconductor chip inspection. Here, we show that the bremsstrahlung intensity can
  be enhanced significantly—by more than three orders of magnitude—through shaping
  the electron wavefunction to periodically overlap with atoms in crystalline materials.
  Furthermore, we show how to shape the bremsstrahlung X-ray emission pattern into
  arbitrary angular emission profiles for purposes such as unidirectionality and multi-directionality.
  Importantly, we find that these enhancements and shaped emission profiles cannot
  be attributed solely to the spatial overlap between the electron probability distribution
  and the atomic centers, as predicted by the paraxial and non-recoil theory for free
  electron light emission. Our work highlights an unprecedented regime of free electron
  light emission where electron waveshaping provides multi-dimensional control over
  practical radiation processes like bremsstrahlung. Our results pave the way towards
  greater versatility in table-top X-ray sources and improved fundamental understanding
  of quantum electron-light interactions.
