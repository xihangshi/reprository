 abstract = {Opossums fed the chemical carcinogen ethyl nitrosourea early in postnatal life developed a variety of epithelial and mesenchymal embryonal neoplasms that were closely analogous, in morphology and biological behavior, to tumors of human infancy and childhood for which experimental models in laboratory animals are either imprecise or nonexistent. The embryonal tumors were found in association with, and occasionally at the same sites as, a limited number of malformations.},
