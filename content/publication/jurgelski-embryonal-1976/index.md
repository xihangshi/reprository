abstract: Opossums fed the chemical carcinogen ethyl nitrosourea early in postnatal
  life developed a variety of epithelial and mesenchymal embryonal neoplasms that
  were closely analogous, in morphology and biological behavior, to tumors of human
  infancy and childhood for which experimental models in laboratory animals are either
  imprecise or nonexistent. The embryonal tumors were found in association with, and
  occasionally at the same sites as, a limited number of malformations.
