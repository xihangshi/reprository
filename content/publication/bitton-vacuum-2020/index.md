abstract: Abstract Recent years have seen a growing interest in strong coupling between
  plasmons and excitons, as a way to generate new quantum optical testbeds and influence
  chemical dynamics and reactivity. Strong coupling to bright plasmonic modes has
  been achieved even with single quantum emitters. Dark plasmonic modes fare better
  in some applications due to longer lifetimes, but are difficult to probe as they
  are subradiant. Here, we apply electron energy loss (EEL) spectroscopy to demonstrate
  that a dark mode of an individual plasmonic bowtie can interact with a small number
  of quantum emitters, as evidenced by Rabi-split spectra. Coupling strengths of up
  to 85 meV place the bowtie-emitter devices at the onset of the strong coupling regime.
  Remarkably, the coupling occurs at the periphery of the bowtie gaps, even while
  the electron beam probes their center. Our findings pave the way for using EEL spectroscopy
  to study exciton-plasmon interactions involving non-emissive photonic modes.
