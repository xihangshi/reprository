 abstract = {We study the behavior of a free electron laser in the high gain regime, and the conditions for the emergence of a collective instability in the electron beam-undulator-field system. Our equations, in the appropriate limit, yield the traditional small gain formula. In the nonlinear regime, numerical solutions of the coupled equations of motion support the correctness of our proposed empirical estimator for the build-up time of the pulses, and indicate the existence of optimum parameters for the production of high peak-power radiation.},
