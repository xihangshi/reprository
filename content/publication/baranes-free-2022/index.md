abstract: Entanglement of photons is a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics, which
  stands at the core of quantum technologies such as photonic quantum computing, communication,
  and sensing. An ongoing challenge in all these is finding an efficient and controllable
  mechanism to entangle photons. Recent experimental developments in electron microscopy
  enable to control the quantum interaction between free electrons and light. Here,
  we show that free electrons can create entanglement and bunching of light. Free
  electrons can control the second-order coherence of initially independent photonic
  states, even in spatially separated cavities that cannot directly interact. Free
  electrons thus provide a type of optical nonlinearity that acts in a nonlocal manner,
  offering a way of heralding the creation of entanglement. Intriguingly, pre-shaping
  the electronâ€™s wavefunction provides the knob for tuning the photonic quantum correlations.
  The concept can be generalized to entangle not only photons but also photonic quasiparticles
  such as plasmon-polaritons and phonons.
