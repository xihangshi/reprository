abstract: Dispersion engineering is essential for spectral utilization in electromagnetic
  systems. However, it is difficult to manage the dispersions in both natural materials
  and traditional electromagnetic waveguides since they are tightly related to fine
  structures of atoms, molecules and causality. The emergence of metamaterials and
  metasurfaces, which are made of subwavelength inclusions offers tremendous freedom
  to manipulate the electromagnetic parameters of materials and modes. Here, we review
  the basic principles, practical applications and recent advancements of the dispersion
  engineering in metadevices. The contributions of dispersion management in metadevice-based
  super-resolution imaging/nanolithography systems, planar functional devices, as
  well as the broadband perfect absorbers/polarization converters are discussed in
  depth. The challenges faced by this field as well as future developing trends are
  also presented in the conclusions.
