abstract: Recently two emerging areas of research, attosecond and nanoscale physics,
  have started to come together. Attosecond physics deals with phenomena occurring
  when ultrashort laser pulses, with duration on the femto- and sub-femtosecond time
  scales, interact with atoms, molecules or solids. The laser-induced electron dynamics
  occurs natively on a timescale down to a few hundred or even tens of attoseconds
  (1 attosecond  =  1 as  =  10−18 s), which is comparable with the optical field.
  For comparison, the revolution of an electron on a 1s orbital of a hydrogen atom
  is  ∼152 as. On the other hand, the second branch involves the manipulation and
  engineering of mesoscopic systems, such as solids, metals and dielectrics, with
  nanometric precision. Although nano-engineering is a vast and well-established research
  field on its own, the merger with intense laser physics is relatively recent.  In
  this report on progress we present a comprehensive experimental and theoretical
  overview of physics that takes place when short and intense laser pulses interact
  with nanosystems, such as metallic and dielectric nanostructures. In particular
  we elucidate how the spatially inhomogeneous laser induced fields at a nanometer
  scale modify the laser-driven electron dynamics. Consequently, this has important
  impact on pivotal processes such as above-threshold ionization and high-order harmonic
  generation. The deep understanding of the coupled dynamics between these spatially
  inhomogeneous fields and matter configures a promising way to new avenues of research
  and applications. Thanks to the maturity that attosecond physics has reached, together
  with the tremendous advance in material engineering and manipulation techniques,
  the age of atto-nanophysics has begun, but it is in the initial stage. We present
  thus some of the open questions, challenges and prospects for experimental confirmation
  of theoretical predictions, as well as experiments aimed at characterizing the induced
  fields and the unique electron dynamics initiated by them with high temporal and
  spatial resolution.
