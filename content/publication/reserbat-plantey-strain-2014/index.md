abstract: We investigate the organized formation of strain, ripples, and suspended
  features in macroscopic graphene sheets transferred onto corrugated substrates made
  of an ordered array of silica pillars with variable geometries. Depending on the
  pitch and sharpness of the corrugated array, graphene can conformally coat the surface,
  partially collapse, or lie fully suspended between pillars in a fakir-like fashion
  over tens of micrometers. With increasing pillar density, ripples in collapsed films
  display a transition from random oriented pleats emerging from pillars to organized
  domains of parallel ripples linking pillars, eventually leading to suspended tent-like
  features. Spatially resolved Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and electronic
  microscopy reveal uniaxial strain domains in the transferred graphene, which are
  induced and controlled by the geometry. We propose a simple theoretical model to
  explain the structural transition between fully suspended and collapsed graphene.
  For the arrays of high density pillars, graphene membranes stay suspended over macroscopic
  distances with minimal interaction with the pillars apexes. It offers a platform
  to tailor stress in graphene layers and opens perspectives for electron transport
  and nanomechanical applications.
