abstract:  Chiral plasmonic nanoantennas exhibit unique chiroptical properties
  in both the near‐field and far‐field, offering exciting opportunities for applications
  in chiroptical sensing, circularly polarized luminescence, and quantum communication.
  Recent advances in chiral plasmonics have facilitated the creation of nanoparticles
  with intrinsic chirality at the single‐particle level. However, the far‐field directionality
  of these chiral nanoantennas is not well understood. In this work, A numerical study
  is conducted on a single plasmonic nanoantenna that undergoes a size‐preserving
  compression, transitioning from a straight nanorod to left‐ or right‐handed helices
  with varying pitches. These nanostructures showcase distinct mode‐dependent chiroptical
  far‐field properties, encompassing positive or negative dissymmetry factors, 3D
  power radiation patterns, and angular distribution of circular polarization, under
  both plane‐wave and point‐source excitations. The findings provide new insights
  into angle‐resolved spectroscopies of intrinsically chiral plasmonic nanoparticles
  and the applications of chiral plasmonic nanoantennas for controlling circularly
  polarized light emission in nanophotonics.
