abstract: A new kind of wiggler is proposed as an improved source of synchrotron radiation
  from high-energy electron storage rings. The electrons are made to travel in a short-period
  helix by a transverse helical magnetic field. The radiation spectrum produced is
  calculated and it is shown that the helical wiggler design could produce a total
  intensity (photons sec−1 per unit bandwidth) improvement of several hundred and
  a brightness (photons sec−1 per solid angle per unit bandwidth) improvement of 4×104
  over the present state of the art in synchrotron radiation sources.
