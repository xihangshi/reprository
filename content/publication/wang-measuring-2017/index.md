abstract: Monolayer two-dimensional (2D) crystals exhibit a host of intriguing properties,
  but the most exciting applications may come from stacking them into multilayer structures.
  Interlayer and interfacial shear interactions could play a crucial role in the performance
  and reliability of these applications, but little is known about the key parameters
  controlling shear deformation across the layers and interfaces between 2D materials.
  Herein, we report the first measurement of the interlayer shear stress of bilayer
  graphene based on pressurized microscale bubble loading devices. We demonstrate
  continuous growth of an interlayer shear zone outside the bubble edge and extract
  an interlayer shear stress of 40 kPa based on a membrane analysis for bilayer graphene
  bubbles. Meanwhile, a much higher interfacial shear stress of 1.64 MPa was determined
  for monolayer graphene on a silicon oxide substrate. Our results not only provide
  insights into the interfacial shear responses of the thinnest structures possible,
  but also establish an experimental method for characterizing the fundamental interlayer
  shear properties of the emerging 2D materials for potential applications in multilayer
  systems.
