abstract: The use of infrared lasers to power optical-scale lithographically fabricated
  particle accelerators is a developing area of research that has garnered increasing
  interest in recent years. The physics and technology of this approach is reviewed,
  which is referred to as dielectric laser acceleration (DLA). In the DLA scheme operating
  at typical laser pulse lengths of 0.1 to 1 ps, the laser damage fluences for robust
  dielectric materials correspond to peak surface electric fields in the GV/m regime.
  The corresponding accelerating field enhancement represents a potential reduction
  in active length of the accelerator between 1 and 2 orders of magnitude. Power sources
  for DLA-based accelerators (lasers) are less costly than microwave sources (klystrons)
  for equivalent average power levels due to wider availability and private sector
  investment. Because of the high laser-to-particle coupling efficiency, required
  pulse energies are consistent with tabletop microJoule class lasers. Combined with
  the very high (MHz) repetition rates these lasers can provide, the DLA approach
  appears promising for a variety of applications, including future high-energy physics
  colliders, compact light sources, and portable medical scanners and radiative therapy
  machines.
