abstract: "In soft ferromagnetic materials, the smoothly varying magnetization leads
  to the formation of fundamental patterns such as domains, vortices and domain walls.
  These have been studied extensively in thin films of thicknesses up to around 200
  nanometres, in which the magnetization is accessible with current transmission imaging
  methods that make use of electrons or soft X-rays. In thicker samples, however,
  in which the magnetization structure varies throughout the thickness and is intrinsically
  three dimensional, determining the complex magnetic structure directly still represents
  a challenge. We have developed hard-X-ray vector nanotomography with which to determine
  the three-dimensional magnetic configuration at the nanoscale within micrometre-sized
  samples. We imaged the structure of the magnetization within a soft magnetic pillar
  of diameter 5 micrometres with a spatial resolution of 100 nanometres and, within
  the bulk, observed a complex magnetic configuration that consists of vortices and
  antivortices that form cross-tie walls and vortex walls along intersecting planes.
  At the intersections of these structures, magnetic singularities - Bloch points
  - occur. These were predicted more than fifty years ago but have so far not been
  directly observed. Here we image the three-dimensional magnetic structure in the
  vicinity of the Bloch points, which until now has been accessible only through micromagnetic
  simulations, and identify two possible magnetization configurations: a circulating
  magnetization structure and a twisted state that appears to correspond to an 'anti-Bloch
  point'. Our imaging method enables the nanoscale study of topological magnetic structures
  in systems with sizes of the order of tens of micrometres. Knowledge of internal
  nanomagnetic textures is critical for understanding macroscopic magnetic properties
  and for designing bulk magnets for technological applications."
