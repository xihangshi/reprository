abstract: A novel type of monochromatic X-ray emission in crystals was found using
  the internal electron beam of the Tomsk synchrotron (E = 900 Me V). A good agreement
  was obtained between the measured photon spectra and the theoretical spectra. This
  indicates that the parametric (quasi-Cerenkov) radiation emitted by relativistic
  electrons in crystals may be used as a source of monochromatic X-ray photons up
  to energies of 100 keV.
