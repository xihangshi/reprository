 abstract = {A novel type of monochromatic X-ray emission in crystals was found using the internal electron beam of the Tomsk synchrotron (E = 900 Me V). A good agreement was obtained between the measured photon spectra and the theoretical spectra. This indicates that the parametric (quasi-Cerenkov) radiation emitted by relativistic electrons in crystals may be used as a source of monochromatic X-ray photons up to energies of 100 keV.},
