abstract: Coherent emission of light by free charged particles is believed to be successfully
  captured by classical electromagnetism in all experimental settings. However, recent
  advances triggered fundamental questions regarding the role of the particle wave
  function in these processes. Here, we find that even in seemingly classical experimental
  regimes, light emission is fundamentally tied to the quantum coherence and correlations
  of the emitting particle. We use quantum electrodynamics to show how the particleâ€™s
  momentum uncertainty determines the optical coherence of the emitted light. We find
  that the temporal duration of Cherenkov radiation, envisioned for almost a century
  as a shock wave of light, is limited by underlying entanglement between the particle
  and light. Our findings enable new capabilities in electron microscopy for measuring
  quantum correlations of shaped electrons. Last, we propose new Cherenkov detection
  schemes, whereby measuring spectral photon autocorrelations can unveil the wave
  function structure of any charged high-energy particle.
