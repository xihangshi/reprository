 abstract = {A model of the free electron laser is proposed which is based on the classical current of the electron in the wiggler field interacting with a quantized radiation field. To calculate the gain, the quantum recoil for the processes of n-photon emission and absorption must be put in by hand from kinematical considerations. Apart from a spontaneous emission term the gain agrees essentially with the usual small signal expression, for the radiation field being in either an eigenstate of photon number or in a coherent state. The distribution of the electrons after the interaction is, however, essentially quantum mechanical.},
