abstract: A model of the free electron laser is proposed which is based on the classical
  current of the electron in the wiggler field interacting with a quantized radiation
  field. To calculate the gain, the quantum recoil for the processes of n-photon emission
  and absorption must be put in by hand from kinematical considerations. Apart from
  a spontaneous emission term the gain agrees essentially with the usual small signal
  expression, for the radiation field being in either an eigenstate of photon number
  or in a coherent state. The distribution of the electrons after the interaction
  is, however, essentially quantum mechanical.
