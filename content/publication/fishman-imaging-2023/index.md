abstract: Controlling optical fields on the subwavelength scale is at the core of
  nanophotonics. Laser-driven nanophotonic particle accelerators promise a compact
  alternative to conventional radiofrequency-based accelerators. Efficient electron
  acceleration in nanophotonic devices critically depends on achieving nanometer control
  of the internal optical nearfield. However, these nearfields have so far been inaccessible
  due to the complexity of the devices and their geometrical constraints, hampering
  the design of future nanophotonic accelerators. Here we image the field distribution
  inside a nanophotonic accelerator, for which we developed a technique for frequency-tunable
  deep-subwavelength resolution of nearfields based on photon-induced nearfield electron-microscopy.
  Our experiments, complemented by 3D simulations, unveil surprising deviations in
  two leading nanophotonic accelerator designs, showing complex field distributions
  related to intricate 3D features in the device and its fabrication tolerances. We
  envision an extension of our method for full 3D field tomography, which is key for
  the future design of highly efficient nanophotonic devices.
