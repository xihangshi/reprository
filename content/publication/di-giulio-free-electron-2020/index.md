abstract: Controlling the wave function of free electrons is important to improve
  the spatial resolution of electron microscopes, the efficiency of electron interaction
  with sample modes of interest, and our ability to probe ultrafast materials dynamics
  at the nanoscale. In this context, attosecond electron compression has been recently
  demonstrated through interaction with the near fields created by scattering of ultrashort
  laser pulses at nanostructures followed by free-electron propagation. Here, we show
  that control over electron pulse shaping, compression, and statistics can be improved
  by replacing coherent laser excitation by interaction with quantum light. We find
  that compression is accelerated for fixed optical intensity by using phase-squeezed
  light, while amplitude squeezing produces ultrashort double-pulse profiles. The
  generated electron pulses exhibit periodic revivals in complete analogy to the optical
  Talbot effect. We further reveal that the coherences created in a sample by interaction
  with the modulated electron are strongly dependent on the statistics of the modulating
  light, while the diagonal part of the sample density matrix reduces to a Poissonian
  distribution regardless of the type of light used to shape the electron. The present
  study opens a new direction toward the generation of free-electron pulses with additional
  control over duration, shape, and statistics, which directly affect their interaction
  with a sample.
