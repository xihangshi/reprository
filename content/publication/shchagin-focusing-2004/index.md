abstract: The possibility of focusing parametric x rays (PXRs) without x-ray optics
  has been shown. Parametric x rays are emitted by channeled relativistic charged
  particles moving along a bent crystal. Parametric x rays emitted from the entire
  length of the bent crystal are focused at two points on the bending axis of the
  crystal. The Huygens picture of formation of focused PXRs is given. The width of
  the spectral peak of this radiation has been estimated. Certain properties of focused
  PXRs are estimated for typical experimental conditions, and possibilities for the
  application of focused PXRs are discussed. An experiment for the observation of
  focused PXRs has been proposed. It has been shown that focused PXRs can be observed
  for a proton energy of several tens of GeVs or higher. Â© 2004 MAIK \"Nauka/Interperiodica\".
