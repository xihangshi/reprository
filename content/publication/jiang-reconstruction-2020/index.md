abstract: Abstract Controlled synthesis of nanostructure ultrathin films is critical
  for applications in nanoelectronics, photonics, and energy generation and storage.
  The paucity of structural probes that are sensitive to nanometer-thick films and
  also capable of in-operando conditions with high spatiotemporal resolutions limits
  the understanding of morphology and dynamics in ultrathin films. Similar to X-ray
  fluorescence holography for crystals, where holograms are formed through the interference
  between the reference and the object waves, we demonstrated that an ultrathin film,
  being an X-ray waveguide, can also generate fluorescence holograms as a result of
  the establishment of X-ray standing waves. Coupled with model-independent reconstruction
  algorithms based on rigorous dynamical scattering theories, the thin-film-based
  X-ray waveguide fluorescence holography becomes a unique in situ and time-resolved
  imaging probe capable of elucidating the real-time nanostructure kinetics with unprecedented
  resolutions. Combined with chemical sensitive spectroscopic analysis, the reconstruction
  can yield element-specific morphology of embedding nanostructures in ultrathin films.
