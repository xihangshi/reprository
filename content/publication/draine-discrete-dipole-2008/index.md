abstract: The discrete-dipole approximation (DDA) for scattering calculations, including
  the relationship between the DDA and other methods, is reviewed. Computational considerations,
  i.e., the use of complex-conjugate gradient algorithms and fast-Fourier-transform
  methods, are discussed. We test the accuracy of the DDA by using the DDA to compute
  scattering and absorption by isolated, homogeneous spheres as well as by targets
  consisting of two contiguous spheres. It is shown that, for dielectric materials
  (textbarmtextbarâ‰² 2), the DDA permits calculations of scattering and absorption
  that are accurate to within a few percent.
