abstract: Physics of structured waves is currently limited to relatively small particle
  energies as the available generation techniques are only applicable to the soft
  X-ray twisted photons, to the beams of electron microscopes, to cold neutrons, or
  non-relativistic atoms. The highly energetic vortex particles with an orbital angular
  momentum would come in handy for a number of experiments in atomic physics, nuclear,
  hadronic, and accelerator physics, and to generate them one needs to develop alternative
  methods, applicable for ultrarelativistic energies and for composite particles.
  Here, we show that the vortex states of in principle arbitrary particles can be
  generated during photon emission in helical undulators, via Cherenkov radiation,
  in collisions of charged particles with intense laser beams, in such scattering
  or annihilation processes as $$emu rightarrow emu , ep rightarrow ep, etextasciicircum-etextasciicircum+
  rightarrow pbarp$$, and so forth. The key element in obtaining them is the postselection
  protocol due to entanglement between a pair of final particles and it is largely
  not the process itself. The state of a final particle – be it a $$gamma $$-ray,
  a hadron, a nucleus, or an ion – becomes twisted if the azimuthal angle of the other
  particle momentum is measured with a large error or is not measured at all. As a
  result, requirements to the beam transverse coherence can be greatly relaxed, which
  enables the generation of highly energetic vortex beams at accelerators and synchrotron
  radiation facilities, thus making them a new tool for hadronic and spin studies.
