abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials1,2 and the associated van der Waals (vdW)
  heterostructures3–7 have provided great flexibility for integrating distinct atomic
  layers beyond the traditional limits of lattice-matching requirements, through layer-by-layer
  mechanical restacking or sequential synthesis. However, the 2D vdW heterostructures
  explored so far have been usually limited to relatively simple heterostructures
  with a small number of blocks8–18. The preparation of high-order vdW superlattices
  with larger number of alternating units is exponentially more difficult, owing to
  the limited yield and material damage associated with each sequential restacking
  or synthesis step8–29. Here we report a straightforward approach to realizing high-order
  vdW superlattices by rolling up vdW heterostructures. We show that a capillary-force-driven
  rolling-up process can be used to delaminate synthetic SnS2/WSe2 vdW heterostructures
  from the growth substrate and produce SnS2/WSe2 roll-ups with alternating monolayers
  of WSe2 and SnS2, thus forming high-order SnS2/WSe2 vdW superlattices. The formation
  of these superlattices modulates the electronic band structure and the dimensionality,
  resulting in a transition of the transport characteristics from semiconducting to
  metallic, from 2D to one-dimensional (1D), with an angle-dependent linear magnetoresistance.
  This strategy can be extended to create diverse 2D/2D vdW superlattices, more complex
  2D/2D/2D vdW superlattices, and beyond-2D materials, including three-dimensional
  (3D) thin-film materials and 1D nanowires, to generate mixed-dimensional vdW superlattices,
  such as 3D/2D, 3D/2D/2D, 1D/2D and 1D/3D/2D vdW superlattices. This study demonstrates
  a general approach to producing high-order vdW superlattices with widely variable
  material compositions, dimensions, chirality and topology, and defines a rich material
  platform for both fundamental studies and technological applications.
