abstract: Abstract High harmonic generation (HHG) is an extremely nonlinear effect
  generating coherent broadband radiation and pulse durations reaching attosecond
  timescales. Conventional models of HHG that treat the driving and emitted fields
  classically are usually very successful but inherently cannot capture the quantum-optical
  nature of the process. Although prior work considered quantum HHG, it remains unknown
  in what conditions the spectral and statistical properties of the radiation depart
  considerably from the known phenomenology of HHG. The discovery of such conditions
  could lead to novel sources of attosecond light having squeezing and entanglement.
  Here, we present a fully-quantum theory of extreme nonlinear optics, predicting
  quantum effects that alter both the spectrum and photon statistics of HHG, thus
  departing from all previous approaches. We predict the emission of shifted frequency
  combs and identify spectral features arising from the breakdown of the dipole approximation
  for the emission. Our results show that each frequency component of HHG can be bunched
  and squeezed and that each emitted photon is a superposition of all frequencies
  in the spectrum, i.e., each photon is a comb. Our general approach is applicable
  to a wide range of nonlinear optical processes, paving the way towards novel quantum
  phenomena in extreme nonlinear optics.
