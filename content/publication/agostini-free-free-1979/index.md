abstract: The energy spectrum of electrons produced by multiphoton ionization of xenon
  atoms has been analyzed with a retarding potential technique. We have shown that
  the discrete absorption of photons above the six-photon ionization threshold was
  observable under specified conditions. A simple model based upon inverse bremsstrahlung
  gives a resonable agreement with the experiments. Â© 1979 The American Physical Society.
