 abstract = {The energy spectrum of electrons produced by multiphoton ionization of xenon atoms has been analyzed with a retarding potential technique. We have shown that the discrete absorption of photons above the six-photon ionization threshold was observable under specified conditions. A simple model based upon inverse bremsstrahlung gives a resonable agreement with the experiments. Â© 1979 The American Physical Society.},
