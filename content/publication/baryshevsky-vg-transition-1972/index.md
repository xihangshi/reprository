abstract: An analysis has been made of the production of transition y radiation in
  a crystal. It is shown that transition y rays with a wave vector satisfying the
  Bragg condition have in the crystal an anomalous penetration similar to the anomalous
  penetration through a crystal of beams of y rays and x rays. It is shown also that
  this leads to a sharp increase in the intensity of transition radiation under the
  conditions of diffraction.
