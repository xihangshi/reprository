 abstract = {An analysis has been made of the production of transition y radiation in a crystal. It is shown that transition y rays with a wave vector satisfying the Bragg condition have in the crystal an anomalous penetration similar to the anomalous penetration through a crystal of beams of y rays and x rays. It is shown also that this leads to a sharp increase in the intensity of transition radiation under the conditions of diffraction.},
