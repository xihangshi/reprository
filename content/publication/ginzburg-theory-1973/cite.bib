 abstract = {A theory of transition radiation in a medium with a time-varying refractive index (which is assumed to vary in a steplike manner) is developed. Along with the radiation field and energy (including the relativistic case), calculations are performed for the work of the radiative friction on the radiating particle and also for the change in energy of the field dragged by the particle. Transition radiation was first studied in a case when a uniformly moving charged particle crossed an abrupt interface between two media[1J. Subsequently, a number of other problems of transition-radiation theory was also investigated (see the reviews[2,3 J), and transition radia-tion produced in a homogeneous medium when its proper-ties change abruptly in time has recently attracted attention [4J. Such a possibility is clear already from the general considerations that lead to the conclusion that transition radiation exists. Indeed, in a medium with refractive index N = (1/2 the radiation is produced when the parameter vN/c changes with time (v is the particle velocity and c is the speed of light in vacuum; the case of Cerenkov radiation is not considered at pres-ent). An important role is played here by the change of this parameter at a spot occupied by a charge (or by some other emitter). It is obvious that at constant veloc-ity v the parameter vN/c varies both in a spatially in-homogeneous medium (the usual transition radiauon) and in a spatially homogeneous medium but one in which N varies with time. This type of transition radiation has its own peculiarities and does not reduce by far to tran-sition radiation in a spatially inhomogeneous medium. We note that transition radiation in a medium that varies in time and in space sinusoidally was considered in [5J . We discuss in this article the problem of transition radiation in a non stationary medium with an abrupt var-iation of N with time, and examine the region of applica-bility of such an. approximation for variation of the re-fractive index in a dispersive medium. We estimate the time of formation of the radiation. We discuss in con-siderable detail the radiation of an ultrarelativistic par-ticle. We also calculate the work done by the radiation force on a radiating particle, and take into account the effect of particle-mass renormalization in a medium with variable parameters. Finally, we carry out a com-parison with the usual transition radiation for an inter-face between two media.},
