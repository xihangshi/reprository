abstract: A transmission type flat-panel X-ray source in diode structure was fabricated.
  Large-scale patterned ZnO nanowires grown on a glass substrate by thermal oxidation
  were utilized as field emitters, and tungsten thin film coated on silica glass was
  used as the transmission anode. Uniform distribution of X-ray generation was achieved,
  which benefited from the uniform electron emission from ZnO nanowires. Self-ballasting
  effect induced by the intrinsic resistance of ZnO nanowire and decreasing of screening
  effect caused by patterned emitters account for the uniform emission. Characteristic
  X-ray peaks of W-L lines and bremsstrahlung X-rays have been observed under anode
  voltages at a range of 18–20 kV, the latter of which were the dominant X-ray signals.
  High-resolution X-ray images with spatial resolution less than 25 μm were obtained
  by the flat-panel X-ray source. The high resolution was attributed to the small
  divergence angle of the emitted X-rays from the transmission X-ray source.
