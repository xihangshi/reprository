abstract: The strong fields associated with few-cycle pulses can drive highly nonlinear
  phenomena, allowing the direct control of electrons in condensed matter systems.
  In this context, by employing near-infrared single-cycle pulse pairs, we measure
  interferometric autocorrelations of the ultrafast currents induced by optical field
  emission at the nanogap of a single plasmonic nanocircuit. The dynamics of this
  ultrafast electron nanotransport depends on the precise temporal field profile of
  the optical driving pulse. Current autocorrelations are acquired with sub-femtosecond
  temporal resolution as a function of both pulse delay and absolute carrier-envelope
  phase. Quantitative modelling of the experiments enables us to monitor the spatiotemporal
  evolution of the electron density and currents induced in the system and to elucidate
  the physics underlying the electron transfer driven by strong optical fields in
  plasmonic gaps. Specifically, we clarify the interplay between the carrier-envelope
  phase of the driving pulse, plasmonic resonance and quiver motion.
