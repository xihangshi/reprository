abstract: Strong excitation of nuclear resonances, particularly of Moössbauer nuclei,
  has been a longstanding goal and the advance of novel x-ray sources is promising
  new options in this regard. Here we map out the necessary experimental conditions
  for the more general goal of realizing nonlinear optics with nuclei and compare
  with available technology. In particular, we present a comprehensive theory of nonlinear
  nuclear excitation in thin-film x-ray cavities by focused x-ray pulses. We thereby
  identify cavity geometries with broad resonances which allow one to boost the nuclear
  excitation even at moderately tight focusing.
