abstract: Abstract This chapter addresses fundamental concepts of X-ray optics and
  X-ray coherence, in view of the increasing number of X-ray applications requiring
  nano-focused X-ray beams. The chapter is meant as a tutorial to facilitate the understanding
  of later chapters of this book. After the introduction and an overview over focusing
  optics and recent benchmarks in X-ray focusing, we present refractive, reflective
  and diffractive X-ray optics in more detail. Particular emphasis is given to two
  kinds of X-ray optics which are particularly relevant for later chapters in this
  book, namely X-ray waveguides (XWG) and multilayer zone plates (MZP). Both are geared
  towards ultimate confinement and focusing, respectively, i.e. applications at the
  forefront of what is currently possible for multi-keV radiation. Since optics must
  be designed in view of coherence properties, we include a basic treatment of coherence
  theory and simulation for X-ray optics. Finally, the chapter closes with a brief
  outlook on compound (combined) optical schemes for hard X-ray microscopy.
