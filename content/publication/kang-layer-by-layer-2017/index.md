abstract: High-performance semiconductor films with vertical compositions that are
  designed to atomic-scale precision provide the foundation for modern integrated
  circuitry and novel materials discovery. One approach to realizing such films is
  sequential layer-by-layer assembly, whereby atomically thin two-dimensional building
  blocks are vertically stacked, and held together by van der Waals interactions.
  With this approach, graphene and transition-metal dichalcogenides - which represent
  one- And three-atom-thick two-dimensional building blocks, respectively - have been
  used to realize previously inaccessible heterostructures with interesting physical
  properties. However, no large-scale assembly method exists at present that maintains
  the intrinsic properties of these two-dimensional building blocks while producing
  pristine interlayer interfaces, thus limiting the layer-by-layer assembly method
  to small-scale proof-of-concept demonstrations. Here we report the generation of
  wafer-scale semiconductor films with a very high level of spatial uniformity and
  pristine interfaces. The vertical composition and properties of these films are
  designed at the atomic scale using layer-by-layer assembly of two-dimensional building
  blocks under vacuum. We fabricate several large-scale, high-quality heterostructure
  films and devices, including superlattice films with vertical compositions designed
  layer-by-layer, batch-fabricated tunnel device arrays with resistances that can
  be tuned over four orders of magnitude, band-engineered heterostructure tunnel diodes,
  and millimetre-scale ultrathin membranes and windows. The stacked films are detachable,
  suspendable and compatible with water or plastic surfaces, which will enable their
  integration with advanced optical and mechanical systems.
