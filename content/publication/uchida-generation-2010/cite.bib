 abstract = {In addition to the angular momentum carried by a photon's spin (represented by its polarization), light beams can also be engineered to carry orbital angular momentum. Such beams find a variety of uses, for example, as optical 'spanners' â€” essentially a 'twisted' variant of the more familiar optical tweezers. Now Masaya Uchida and Akira Tonomura show that it is possible in principle to engineer similar behaviour into an electron beam, which could find use in a variety of spectroscopy and microscopy techniques.},
