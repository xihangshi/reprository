abstract: In addition to the angular momentum carried by a photon's spin (represented
  by its polarization), light beams can also be engineered to carry orbital angular
  momentum. Such beams find a variety of uses, for example, as optical 'spanners'
  â€” essentially a 'twisted' variant of the more familiar optical tweezers. Now Masaya
  Uchida and Akira Tonomura show that it is possible in principle to engineer similar
  behaviour into an electron beam, which could find use in a variety of spectroscopy
  and microscopy techniques.
