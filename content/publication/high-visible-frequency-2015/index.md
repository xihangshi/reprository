abstract: Metamaterials are artificial optical media composed of sub- wavelength metallic
  and dielectric building blocks that feature optical phenomena not present in naturally
  occurring materials. Although they can serve as the basis for unique optical devices
  that mould the flow of light in unconventional ways, three-dimensional metamaterials
  suffer from extreme propagation losses. Two- dimensional metamaterials (metasurfaces)
  such as hyperbolic metasurfaces for propagating surface plasmon polaritons have
  the potential to alleviate this problem. Because the surface plasmon polaritons
  are guided at a metal–dielectric interface (rather than passing through metallic
  components), these hyperbolic metasur- faces have been predicted to suffer much
  lower propagation loss while still exhibiting optical phenomena akin to those in
  three- dimensional metamaterials. Moreover, because of their planar nature, these
  devices enable the construction of integrated meta- material circuits as well as
  easy coupling with other optoelectronic elements. Here we report the experimental
  realization of a visible- frequency hyperbolic metasurface using single-crystal
  silver nano- structures defined by lithographic and etching techniques. The resulting
  devices display the characteristic properties of metamaterials, such as negative
  refraction and diffraction-free propagation, with device performance greatly exceeding
  those of previous demonstrations. Moreover, hyperbolic metasurfaces exhibit strong,
  dispersion-dependent spin–orbit coupling, enabling polarization- and wavelength-dependent
  routeing of surface plas- monpolaritons and two-dimensional chiraloptical components.
  These results open the door to realizing integrated optical meta- circuits, with
  wide-ranging applications in areas from imaging and sensing to quantum optics and
  quantum information science.
