abstract: Squeezed light generation has come of age. Significant advances on squeezed
  light generation have been made over the last 30 years—from the initial, conceptual
  experiment in 1985 till today’s top-tuned, application-oriented setups. Here we
  review the main experimental platforms for generating quadrature squeezed light
  that have been investigated in the last 30 years.
