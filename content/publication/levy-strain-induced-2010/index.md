abstract: Recent theoretical proposals suggest that strain can be used to engineer
  graphene electronic states through the creation of a pseudo-magnetic field. This
  effect is unique to graphene because of its massless Dirac fermion-like band structure
  and particular lattice symmetry (C3v). Here, we present experimental spectroscopic
  measurements by scanning tunneling microscopy of highly strained nanobubbles that
  form when graphene is grown on a platinum (111) surface. The nanobubbles exhibit
  Landau levels that form in the presence of strain-induced pseudo-magnetic fields
  greater than 300 tesla. This demonstration of enormous pseudo-magnetic fields opens
  the door to both the study of charge carriers in previously inaccessible high magnetic
  field regimes and deliberate mechanical control over electronic structure in graphene
  or so-called \"strain engineering.\".
