abstract: This book gives a thorough treatment of the rapidly-expanding field of coherent
  x-ray optics, which has recently experienced something of a renaissance with the
  availability of third-generation synchrotron sources. It is the first book of its
  kind. The author begins with a treatment of the fundamentals of x-ray diffraction
  for both coherent and partially coherent radiation, together with the interactions
  of x-rays with matter. X-ray sources, optics elements and detectors are then discussed,
  with an emphasis on their role in coherent x-ray optics. Various facets of coherent
  x-ray imaging are then discussed, including holography, interferometry, self imaging,
  phase contrast and phase retrieval. Lastly, the foundations of the new field of
  singular x-ray optics are examined. Most topics are developed from first principles,
  with numerous references given to the contemporary research literature. This book
  will be useful to x-ray physicists and students, together with optical physicists
  and engineers who wish to learn more about the fascinating subject of coherent x-ray
  optics. , This book gives a thorough treatment of the rapidly-expanding field of
