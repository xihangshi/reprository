abstract: High harmonic radiation, produced when intense laser pulses interact with
  matter, is composed of a train of attosecond pulses. Individual pulses in this train
  carry information on ultrafast dynamics that vary from one half-optical-cycle to
  the next. Here, we demonstrate an all-optical photonic streaking measurement that
  provides direct experimental access to each attosecond pulse by mapping emission
  time onto propagation angle. This is achieved by inducing an ultrafast rotation
  of the instantaneous laser wavefront at the focus. We thus time-resolve attosecond
  pulse train generation, and hence the dynamics in the nonlinear medium itself. We
  apply photonic streaking to harmonic generation in gases and directly observe, for
  the first time, the influence of non-adiabatic electron dynamics and plasma formation
  on the generated attosecond pulse train. These experimental and numerical results
  also provide the first evidence of the generation of attosecond lighthouses in gases,
  which constitute ideal sources for attosecond pump–probe spectroscopy.
