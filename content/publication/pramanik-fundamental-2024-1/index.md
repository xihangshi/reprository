abstract: Water-window X-rays are crucial in medical and biological applications,
  enabling the natural-contrast imaging of biological cells without external staining.
  However, water-window X-ray sources with bespoke photon energies—needed in high-contrast
  imaging—remain challenging to obtain, except at large synchrotron facilities. Here
  we address this challenge by demonstrating tabletop, water-window X-ray generation
  from free-electron-driven van der Waals materials, enabling the continuous tuning
  of photon energies across the entire water-window regime. Additionally, we present
  a truly predictive theoretical framework combining first-principles electromagnetism
  with Monte Carlo simulations to accurately predict the photon flux and brightness
  in absolute quantities. We obtain fundamental scaling laws for the tunable photon
  flux, matching the experimental results and providing a way to design powerful emitters
  based on free-electron-driven quantum materials. We show that we can potentially
  achieve photon fluxes needed for imaging and spectroscopy applications (over 108 photons s–1
  on the sample—verified by our framework based on our experimentally achieved fluxes
  of about 103 photons s–1 using ~50 nA current). Importantly, our theory highlights
  the critical role played by the large mean free paths and interlayer atomic spacings
  unique to van der Waals structures, showing the latter’s advantages over other materials
  in generating water-window X-rays.
