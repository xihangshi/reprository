abstract: Layered semiconductors based on transition-metal chalcogenides usually cross
  from indirect bandgap in the bulk limit over to direct bandgap in the quantum (2D)
  limit. Such a crossover can be achieved by peeling off a multilayer sample to a
  single layer. For exploration of physical behavior and device applications, it is
  much desired to reversibly modulate such crossover in a multilayer sample. Here
  we demonstrate that, in a few-layer sample where the indirect bandgap and direct
  bandgap are nearly degenerate, the temperature rise can effectively drive the system
  toward the 2D limit by thermally decoupling neighboring layers via interlayer thermal
  expansion. Such a situation is realized in few-layer MoSe2, which shows stark contrast
  from the well-explored MoS2 where the indirect and direct bandgaps are far from
  degenerate. Photoluminescence of few-layer MoSe2 is much enhanced with the temperature
  rise, much like the way that the photoluminescence is enhanced due to the bandgap
  crossover going from the bulk to the quantum limit, offering potential applications
  involving external modulation of optical properties in 2D semiconductors. The direct
  bandgap of MoSe2, identified at 1.55 eV, may also promise applications in energy
  conversion involving solar spectrum, as it is close to the optimal bandgap value
  of single-junction solar cells and photoelechemical devices. Â© 2012 American Chemical
