abstract: The mechanism of electron pairing in high-temperature superconductors is
  still the subject of intense debate. Here, we provide direct evidence of the role
  of structural dynamics, with selective atomic motions (buckling of copper–oxygen
  planes), in the anisotropic electron-lattice coupling. The transient structures
  were determined using time-resolved electron diffraction, following carrier excitation
  with polarized femtosecond heating pulses, and examined for different dopings and
  temperatures. The deformation amplitude reaches 0.5% of the c axis value of 30 Å
  when the light polarization is in the direction of the copper–oxygen bond, but its
  decay slows down at 45°. These findings suggest a selective dynamical lattice involvement
  with the anisotropic electron–phonon coupling being on a time scale (1–3.5 ps depending
  on direction) of the same order of magnitude as that of the spin exchange of electron
  pairing in the high-temperature superconducting phase.
