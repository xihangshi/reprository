abstract: Spectral distributions of parametric X-rays (PX) have been measured for
  900 MeV electrons transmitted through a Si crystal. A displacement of the PX spectral
  line was observed with the crystal rotation and in scanning PX radiation reflection
  by a detector. A high degree of linear polarization (P = 0.8) of parametric X-rays
  was obtained. Â© 1989.
