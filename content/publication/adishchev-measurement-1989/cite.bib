 abstract = {Spectral distributions of parametric X-rays (PX) have been measured for 900 MeV electrons transmitted through a Si crystal. A displacement of the PX spectral line was observed with the crystal rotation and in scanning PX radiation reflection by a detector. A high degree of linear polarization (P = 0.8) of parametric X-rays was obtained. Â© 1989.},
