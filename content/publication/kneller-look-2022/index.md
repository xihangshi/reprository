abstract: Interferometry has been at the heart of wave optics since its early stages,
  resolving the coherence of the light field and enabling the complete reconstruction
  of the optical information it encodes. Transferring this concept to the attosecond
  time domain shed new light on fundamental ultrafast electron phenomena. Here we
  introduce attosecond-gated interferometry and probe one of the most fundamental
  quantum mechanical phenomena, field-induced tunnelling. Our experiment probes the
  evolution of an electronic wavefunction under the tunnelling barrier and records
  the phase acquired by an electron as it propagates in a classically forbidden region.
  We identify the quantum nature of the electronic wavepacket and capture its evolution
  within the optical cycle. Attosecond-gated interferometry has the potential to reveal
  the underlying quantum dynamics of strong-field-driven atomic, molecular and solid-state
  systems.
