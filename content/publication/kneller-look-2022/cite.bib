 abstract = {Interferometry has been at the heart of wave optics since its early stages, resolving the coherence of the light field and enabling the complete reconstruction of the optical information it encodes. Transferring this concept to the attosecond time domain shed new light on fundamental ultrafast electron phenomena. Here we introduce attosecond-gated interferometry and probe one of the most fundamental quantum mechanical phenomena, field-induced tunnelling. Our experiment probes the evolution of an electronic wavefunction under the tunnelling barrier and records the phase acquired by an electron as it propagates in a classically forbidden region. We identify the quantum nature of the electronic wavepacket and capture its evolution within the optical cycle. Attosecond-gated interferometry has the potential to reveal the underlying quantum dynamics of strong-field-driven atomic, molecular and solid-state systems.},
