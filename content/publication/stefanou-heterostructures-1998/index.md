abstract: We present a program for the calculation of the frequency band structure
  of an infinite photonic crystal, and of the transmission, reflection and absorption
  coefficients of light by a slab of this crystal. The crystal consists of a stack
  of identical slices parallel to a given surface; a slice may consist of a number
  of different components, each of which can be either a homogeneous plate or a multilayer
  of spherical particles of given periodicity parallel to the surface.
