abstract: Recent advances in the development of electron and X-ray detectors have
  opened up the possibility to detect single events from which its time of arrival
  can be determined with nanosecond resolution. This allows observing time correlations
  between electrons and X-rays in the transmission electron microscope. In this work,
  a novel setup is described which measures individual events using a silicon drift
  detector and digital pulse processor for the X-rays and a Timepix3 detector for
  the electrons. This setup enables recording time correlation between both event
  streams while at the same time preserving the complete conventional electron energy
  loss (EELS) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) signal. We show that the added coincidence
  information improves the sensitivity for detecting trace elements in a matrix as
  compared to conventional EELS and EDX. Furthermore, the method allows the determination
  of the collection efficiencies without the use of a reference sample and can subtract
  the background signal for EELS and EDX without any prior knowledge of the background
  shape and without pre-edge fitting region. We discuss limitations in time resolution
  arising due to specificities of the silicon drift detector and discuss ways to further
  improve this aspect.
