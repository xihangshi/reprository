abstract: Parametric x-radiation can be described as the diffraction of virtual photons
  associated with the electric field of a relativistic charged particles passing through
  a crystal. In analogy with Bragg reflection of x-rays, these diffracted photons
  appear as real photons, with an energy which satisfies Bragg's law for the reflecting
  crystal planes. We describe the results of experiments performed on the Naval Postgraduate
  School linac which were designed to explore the basic properties of PXR in order
  to assess its potential application as a compact tunable x-ray source. Experiments
  using a mosaic graphite radiator show that this radiator produced multiple order,
  narrow bandwidth reflection from 5 - 45 keV. The measured production efficiency
  is fount to exceed that predicted for spectral orders n textgreater 1. We demonstrated
  the tunability of PXR by rotating the crystal in order to change the Bragg angle
  relative to the incident 90 MeV electron beam.
