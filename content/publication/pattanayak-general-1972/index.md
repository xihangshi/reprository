abstract: The classic extinction theorem of molecular optics, due to Ewald and Oseen
  is generalized to scattering of an electromagnetic wave on a material medium of
  completely arbitrary response (constitutive relations). The generalization is carried
  out entirely within the framework of Maxwell's electromagnetic theory. A new interpretation
  of the theorem is proposed and it is shown that it provides a new approach to the
  solution of electromagnetic scattering problems.
