 abstract = {The classic extinction theorem of molecular optics, due to Ewald and Oseen is generalized to scattering of an electromagnetic wave on a material medium of completely arbitrary response (constitutive relations). The generalization is carried out entirely within the framework of Maxwell's electromagnetic theory. A new interpretation of the theorem is proposed and it is shown that it provides a new approach to the solution of electromagnetic scattering problems.},
