abstract: Tabletop coherent x-ray sources extending to multi-keV or higher photon
  energies have versatile applications, including in 4D imaging and semiconductor
  detectors. However, these sources can be realized only via high-order harmonic generation
  (HHG) with an ∼10µm laser interacting with neutral atoms. As shown in previous work
  by Popmintchev et al. [Science 350, 1225 (2015)10.1126/science.aac9755SCIEAS0036-8075],
  multiply ionized plasmas can efficiently produce hundred-eV harmonics with an ultraviolet
  laser. Here, we experimentally investigate multi-keV x-ray sources up to ∼5.2keV,
  the highest photon energy generated via HHG to date, to our knowledge, using a 1.45-µm
  driving laser that interacts with multivalent ions. Both the angular distribution
  and the ellipticity dependence of the signal are strong evidence of the HHG mechanism.
