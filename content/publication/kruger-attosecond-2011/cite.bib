 abstract = {Attosecond techniques exploit the electric field surrounding femtosecond laser pulses to steer electrons, and are widely applied to atoms or molecules in the gas phase. Electrons liberated by few-cycle laser pulses from solids are also predicted to show strong sensitivity to the phase of the light, but observation of this effect has been elusive. Krüger et al. demonstrate the phenomenon in the spectra of electrons laser-emitted from a nanoscale tungsten tip; current modulation of up to 100% and interference are observed, depending on the carrier envelope phase of the laser. This work should facilitate sub-femtosecond, sub-nanometre probing of collective electron dynamics in a range of solid-state systems.},
