abstract: Attosecond techniques exploit the electric field surrounding femtosecond
  laser pulses to steer electrons, and are widely applied to atoms or molecules in
  the gas phase. Electrons liberated by few-cycle laser pulses from solids are also
  predicted to show strong sensitivity to the phase of the light, but observation
  of this effect has been elusive. Krüger et al. demonstrate the phenomenon in the
  spectra of electrons laser-emitted from a nanoscale tungsten tip; current modulation
  of up to 100% and interference are observed, depending on the carrier envelope phase
  of the laser. This work should facilitate sub-femtosecond, sub-nanometre probing
  of collective electron dynamics in a range of solid-state systems.
