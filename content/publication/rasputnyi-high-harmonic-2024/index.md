abstract: Abstract  High-harmonic generation has been driving the development of attosecond
  science and sources. More recently, high-harmonic generation in solids has been
  adopted by other communities as a method to study material properties. However,
  so far high-harmonic generation has only been driven by classical light, despite
  theoretical proposals to do so with quantum states of light. Here we observe non-perturbative
  high-harmonic generation in solids driven by a macroscopic quantum state of light,
  a bright squeezed vacuum, which we generate in a single spatiotemporal mode. The
  process driven by a bright squeezed vacuum is considerably more efficient in the
  generation of high harmonics than classical light of the same mean intensity. Due
  to its broad photon-number distribution, covering states from 0 to 2 × 10 13 photons
  per pulse, and strong subcycle electric field fluctuations, a bright squeezed vacuum
  gives access to free carrier dynamics within a much broader range of peak intensities
  than accessible with classical light.
