 abstract = {The primary step of almost any interaction between light and materials is the electrodynamic response of the electrons to the optical cycles of the impinging light wave on sub-wavelength and sub-cycle dimensions1. Understanding and controlling the electromagnetic responses of a material2–11 is therefore essential for modern optics and nanophotonics12–19. Although the small de Broglie wavelength of electron beams should allow access to attosecond and ångström dimensions20, the time resolution of ultrafast electron microscopy21 and diffraction22 has so far been limited to the femtosecond domain16–18, which is insufficient for recording fundamental material responses on the scale of the cycles of light1,2,10. Here we advance transmission electron microscopy to attosecond time resolution of optical responses within one cycle of excitation light23. We apply a continuous-wave laser24 to modulate the electron wave function into a rapid sequence of electron pulses, and use an energy filter to resolve electromagnetic near-fields in and around a material as a movie in space and time. Experiments on nanostructured needle tips, dielectric resonators and metamaterial antennas reveal a directional launch of chiral surface waves, a delay between dipole and quadrupole dynamics, a subluminal buried waveguide field and a symmetry-broken multi-antenna response. These results signify the value of combining electron microscopy and attosecond laser science to understand light–matter interactions in terms of their fundamental dimensions in space and time.},
