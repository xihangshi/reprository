abstract: The primary step of almost any interaction between light and materials is
  the electrodynamic response of the electrons to the optical cycles of the impinging
  light wave on sub-wavelength and sub-cycle dimensions1. Understanding and controlling
  the electromagnetic responses of a material2–11 is therefore essential for modern
  optics and nanophotonics12–19. Although the small de Broglie wavelength of electron
  beams should allow access to attosecond and ångström dimensions20, the time resolution
  of ultrafast electron microscopy21 and diffraction22 has so far been limited to
  the femtosecond domain16–18, which is insufficient for recording fundamental material
  responses on the scale of the cycles of light1,2,10. Here we advance transmission
  electron microscopy to attosecond time resolution of optical responses within one
  cycle of excitation light23. We apply a continuous-wave laser24 to modulate the
  electron wave function into a rapid sequence of electron pulses, and use an energy
  filter to resolve electromagnetic near-fields in and around a material as a movie
  in space and time. Experiments on nanostructured needle tips, dielectric resonators
  and metamaterial antennas reveal a directional launch of chiral surface waves, a
  delay between dipole and quadrupole dynamics, a subluminal buried waveguide field
  and a symmetry-broken multi-antenna response. These results signify the value of
  combining electron microscopy and attosecond laser science to understand light–matter
  interactions in terms of their fundamental dimensions in space and time.
