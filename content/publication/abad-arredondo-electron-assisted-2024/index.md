abstract: Abstract Thanks to their exceptional spatial, spectral and temporal resolution,
  highly-coherent free-electron beams have emerged as powerful probes for material
  excitations, enabling their characterization even in the quantum regime. Here, we
  investigate strong light–matter coupling through monochromatic and modulated electron
  wavepackets. In particular, we consider an archetypal target, comprising a nanophotonic
  cavity next to a single two-level emitter. We propose a model Hamiltonian describing
  the coherent interaction between the passing electron beam and the hybrid photonic–excitonic
  target, which is constructed using macroscopic quantum electrodynamics and fully
  parameterized in terms of the electromagnetic dyadic Green’s function. Using this
  framework, we first describe electron-energy-loss and cathodoluminescence spectroscopies,
  and photon-induced near-field electron emission microscopy. Finally, we show the
  power of modulated electrons beams as quantum tools for the manipulation of polaritonic
  targets presenting a complex energy landscape of excitations.
