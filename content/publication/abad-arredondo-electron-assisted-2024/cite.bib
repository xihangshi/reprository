Thanks to their exceptional spatial, spectral and temporal resolution, highly-coherent free-electron beams have emerged as powerful probes for material excitations, enabling their characterization even in the quantum regime. Here, we investigate strong light–matter coupling through monochromatic and modulated electron wavepackets. In particular, we consider an archetypal target, comprising a nanophotonic cavity next to a single two-level emitter. We propose a model Hamiltonian describing the coherent interaction between the passing electron beam and the hybrid photonic–excitonic target, which is constructed using macroscopic quantum electrodynamics and fully parameterized in terms of the electromagnetic dyadic Green’s function. Using this framework, we first describe electron-energy-loss and cathodoluminescence spectroscopies, and photon-induced near-field electron emission microscopy. Finally, we show the power of modulated electrons beams as quantum tools for the manipulation of polaritonic targets presenting a complex energy landscape of excitations.},
