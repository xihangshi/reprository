abstract: Crumpled graphene films are widely used, for instance in electronics 1,
  energy storage2,3, composites4,5 and biomedicine6. Although it is known that the
  degree of crumpling affects graphene's properties and the performance of graphene-based
  devices and materials3,5,7, the controlled folding and unfolding of crumpled graphene
  films has not been demonstrated. Here we report an approach to reversibly control
  the crumpling and unfolding of large-area graphene sheets. We show with experiments,
  atomistic simulations and theory that, by harnessing the mechanical instabilities
  of graphene adhered on a biaxially pre-stretched polymer substrate and by controlling
  the relaxation of the pre-strains in a particular order, graphene films can be crumpled
  into tailored self-organized hierarchical structures that mimic superhydrophobic
  leaves. The approach enables us to fabricate large-area conductive coatings and
  electrodes showing superhydrophobicity, high transparency, and tunable wettability
  and transmittance. We also demonstrate that crumpled graphene-polymer laminates
  can be used as artificial-muscle actuators. Â© 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.
