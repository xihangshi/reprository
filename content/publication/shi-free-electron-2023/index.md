abstract: The science and technology of X-ray optics have come far, enabling the focusing
  of X-rays for applications in high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy, imaging, and irradiation.
  In spite of this, many forms of tailoring waves that had substantial impact on applications
  in the optical regime have remained out of reach in the X-ray regime. This disparity
  fundamentally arises from the tendency of refractive indices of all materials to
  approach unity at high frequencies, making X-ray-optical components such as lenses
  and mirrors much harder to create and often less efficient. Here, we propose a new
  concept for X-ray focusing based on inducing a curved wavefront into the X-ray generation
  process, resulting in the intrinsic focusing of X-ray waves. This concept can be
  seen as effectively integrating the optics to be part of the emission mechanism,
  thus bypassing the efficiency limits imposed by X-ray optical components, enabling
  the creation of nanobeams with nanoscale focal spot sizes and micrometer-scale focal
  lengths. Specifically, we implement this concept by designing aperiodic vdW heterostructures
  that shape X-rays when driven by free electrons. The parameters of the focused hotspot,
  such as lateral size and focal depth, are tunable as a function of an interlayer
  spacing chirp and electron energy. Looking forward, ongoing advances in the creation
  of many-layer vdW heterostructures open unprecedented horizons of focusing and arbitrary
  shaping of X-ray nanobeams.
