abstract: Plasmon polaritons are hybrid excitations of light and mobile electrons
  that can confine the energy of long-wavelength radiation at the nanoscale. Plasmon
  polaritons may enable many enigmatic quantum effects, including lasing 1 , topological
  protection2,3 and dipole-forbidden absorption 4 . A necessary condition for realizing
  such phenomena is a long plasmonic lifetime, which is notoriously difficult to achieve
  for highly confined modes 5 . Plasmon polaritons in graphene—hybrids of Dirac quasiparticles
  and infrared photons—provide a platform for exploring light–matter interaction at
  the nanoscale6,7. However, plasmonic dissipation in graphene is substantial 8 and
  its fundamental limits remain undetermined. Here we use nanometre-scale infrared
  imaging to investigate propagating plasmon polaritons in high-mobility encapsulated
  graphene at cryogenic temperatures. In this regime, the propagation of plasmon polaritons
  is primarily restricted by the dielectric losses of the encapsulated layers, with
  a minor contribution from electron–phonon interactions. At liquid-nitrogen temperatures,
  the intrinsic plasmonic propagation length can exceed 10 micrometres, or 50 plasmonic
  wavelengths, thus setting a record for highly confined and tunable polariton modes.
  Our nanoscale imaging results reveal the physics of plasmonic dissipation and will
  be instrumental in mitigating such losses in heterostructure engineering applications.
