abstract: Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation is a key technology for material science,
  attosecond metrology, and lithography. Here, we experimentally demonstrate metasurfaces
  as a superior way to focus EUV light. These devices exploit the fact that holes
  in a silicon membrane have a considerably larger refractive index than the surrounding
  material and efficiently vacuum-guide light with a wavelength of textasciitilde50
  nanometers. This allows the transmission phase at the nanoscale to be controlled
  by the hole diameter. We fabricated an EUV metalens with a 10-millimeter focal length
  that supports numerical apertures of up to 0.05 and used it to focus ultrashort
  EUV light bursts generated by high-harmonic generation down to a 0.7-micrometer
  waist. Our approach introduces the vast light-shaping possibilities provided by
  dielectric metasurfaces to a spectral regime that lacks materials for transmissive
  optics. , Pushing metalenses to extremes The fields of ultrafast spectroscopy and
  semiconductor photolithography rely on very short wavelengths, typically in the
  extreme ultraviolet (EUV) realm. However, most optical materials strongly absorb
  light in this wavelength regime, resulting in a lack of generally available transmissive
  components. Ossiander et al . designed and fabricated a metalens in which a carefully
  engineered array of holes in a thin silicon membrane focuses ultrafast EUV pulses
  close to the diffraction limit by “vacuum guiding.” The results open up transmissive
  optics to the EUV regime. —ISO , Metalens technology can be pushed into the extreme
  ultraviolet wavelength regime.
