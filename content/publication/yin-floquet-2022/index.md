abstract: Recent progress in nanophotonics and material science has inspired a strong
  interest in optically-induced material dynamics, opening new research directions
  in the distinct fields of Floquet matter and time metamaterials. Floquet phenomena
  are historically rooted in the condensed matter community, as they exploit periodic
  temporal drives to unveil novel phases of matter, unavailable in systems at equilibrium.
  In parallel, the field of metamaterials has been offering a platform for exotic
  wave phenomena based on tailored materials at the nanoscale, recently enhanced by
  incorporating time variations and switching as new degrees of freedom. In this Perspective,
  we connect these research areas and describe the exciting opportunities emerging
  from their synergy, hinging on giant wave-matter interactions enabled by metamaterials
  and on the exotic wave dynamics enabled by Floquet and parametric phenomena. We
  envision Floquet metamaterials in which nontrivial modulation dynamics, and their
  interplay with tailored material dispersion and nontrivial material properties such
  as anisotropy, non-Hermiticity and nonreciprocity, introduce a plethora of novel
  opportunities for wave manipulation and control.
