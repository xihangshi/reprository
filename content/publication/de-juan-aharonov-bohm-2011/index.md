abstract: One of the most interesting aspects of graphene is the close relation between
  its structural and electronic properties. The observation of ripples both in free-standing
  graphene and in samples on a substrate has given rise to active investigation of
  the membrane-like properties of graphene, and the origin of the ripples remains
  one of the most interesting open problems concerning this system. The interplay
  of structural and electronic properties is successfully described by the modelling
  of curvature and elastic deformations by fictitious gauge fields. These fields have
  become an experimental reality after the observation of the Landau levels that can
  form in graphene due to strain. Here we propose a device to detect microstresses
  in graphene based on a scanning-tunnelling-microscopy set-up able to measure Aharonov-Bohm
  interferences at the nanometre scale. The predicted interferences in the local density
  of states are created by the fictitious magnetic field associated with elastic deformations
  of the sample. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.
