abstract: We study theoretically the vortex radiation of a relativistic charged particle.
  General expressions for the spectral and angular distributions of angular momentum
  of radiation are derived for an arbitrary moving charge. Special attention is given
  to calculation of the angular momentum of synchrotron radiation. We obtain the spectrum
  and the angular distribution of angular momentum carried by synchrotron radiation.
  Similar expressions for the angular momentum of radiation of a charge moving on
  a spiral trajectory are derived by use of Lorentz transformations. It is shown that
  the main part of angular momentum in this case is emitted at a small angle to the
  vortex axis. Relativistic charged particles at spiral motion are effective source
  of the vortex photon beams at wave lengths ranging from radio waves to gamma rays.
  The obtained equations can be used for calculations of the angular momentum emitted
  by charged particles in the helical undulators and at axial channeling in solid
  crystal.
