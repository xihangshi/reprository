abstract: Abstract Space‐time wave packets are electromagnetic waves with strong correlations
  between their spatial and temporal degrees of freedom. These wave packets have gained
  much attention for fundamental properties like propagation invariance and user‐designed
  group velocities, and for potential applications like optical microscopy, micromanipulation,
  and laser micromachining. Here, free‐electron radiation is presented as a natural
  and versatile source of space‐time wave packets that are ultra‐broadband and highly
  tunable in frequency. For instance, ab initio theory and numerical simulations show
  that the intensity profile of space‐time wave packets from Smith‐Purcell radiation
  can be directly tailored through the grating properties, as well as the velocity
  and shape of the electron bunches. The result of this work indicates a viable way
  of generating space‐time wave packets at exotic frequencies such as the terahertz
  and X‐ray regimes, potentially paving the way toward new methods of shaping electromagnetic
  wave packets through free‐electron radiation.
