abstract: By stacking various two-dimensional (2D) atomic crystals on top of each
  other, it is possible to create multilayer heterostructures and devices with designed
  electronic properties. However, various adsorbates become trapped between layers
  during their assembly, and this not only affects the resulting quality but also
  prevents the formation of a true artificial layered crystal upheld by van der Waals
  interaction, creating instead a laminate glued together by contamination. Transmission
  electron microscopy (TEM) has shown that graphene and boron nitride monolayers,
  the two best characterized 2D crystals, are densely covered with hydrocarbons (even
  after thermal annealing in high vacuum) and exhibit only small clean patches suitable
  for atomic resolution imaging. This observation seems detrimental for any realistic
  prospect of creating van der Waals materials and heterostructures with atomically
  sharp interfaces. Here we employ cross sectional TEM to take a side view of several
  grapheneg-boron nitride heterostructures. We find that the trapped hydrocarbons
  segregate into isolated pockets, leaving the interfaces atomically clean. Moreover,
  we observe a clear correlation between interface roughness and the electronic quality
  of encapsulated graphene. This work proves the concept of heterostructures assembled
  with atomic layer precision and provides their first TEM images. Â© 2012 Macmillan
