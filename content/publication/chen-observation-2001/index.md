abstract: We report the observation of sub-Poisson intensity fluctuations in the coherent
  spontaneous harmonic radiation generated by an infrared free-electron laser in a
  photon counting experiment using a well-defined ensemble of electron pulses. These
  observations constitute the first observation of a nonclassical state of the radiation
  field generated by a beam of free electrons. The fluctuations observed in the experiment
  are smaller than those expected from semiclassical radiation theory, and larger
  than those expected from electron shot noise.
