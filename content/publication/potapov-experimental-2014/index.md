abstract: The electron mean-free-path in Si was measured by EELS using the test structure
  with the certified dimensions as a calibration standard. In a good agreement with
  the previous CBED measurements, the mean-free-path is 150nm for 200keV and 179nm
  for 300keV energy of primary electrons at large collection angles. These values
  are accurately predicted by the model of Iakoubovskii et al. while the model of
  Malis et al. incorporated in common microscopy software underestimates the mean-free-path
  by 15% at least. Correspondingly, the thickness of TEM samples reported in many
  studies of the Si-based materials last decades might be noticeably underestimated.
