abstract: 'The emission of light from charged particles underlies a wealth of scientific
  phenomena and technological applications. Classical theory determines the emitted
  photon energy by assuming an undeflected charged particle trajectory. In 1940, Ginzburg
  pointed out that this assumption breaks down in quantum electrodynamics, resulting
  in shifts—known as quantum recoil—in outgoing photon energies from their classically
  predicted values. Since then, quantum recoil in free-electron light-emission processes,
  including Cherenkov radiation and Smith–Purcell radiation, has been well-studied
  in theory, but an experimental demonstration has remained elusive. Here we present
  an experimental demonstration of quantum recoil, showing that this quantum electrodynamical
  effect is not only observable at room temperature but also robust in the presence
  of other electron-scattering mechanisms. By scattering free electrons off the periodic
  two-dimensional atomic sheets of van der Waals materials in a tabletop platform,
  we show that the X-ray photon energy is accurately predicted only by quantum recoil
  theory. We show that quantum recoil can be enormous, to the point that a classically
  predicted X-ray photon is emitted as an extremely low-energy photon. We envisage
  quantum recoil as a means of precision control over outgoing photon and electron
  spectra, and show that quantum recoil can be tailored through a host of parameters:
  the electron energy, the atomic composition and the tilt angle of the van der Waals
  material. Our results pave the way to tabletop, room-temperature platforms for harnessing
  and investigating quantum electrodynamical effects in electron–photon interactions.'
