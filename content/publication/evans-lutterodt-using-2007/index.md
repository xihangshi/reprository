abstract: We have fabricated and tested a compound lens consisting of an array of
  four kinoform lenses for hard x-ray photons of 11.3 keV. Our data demonstrate that
  it is possible to exceed the critical angle limit by using multiple lenses, while
  retaining lens function, and this suggests a route to practical focusing optics
  for hard x-ray photons with nanometer scale resolution and below. Â© 2007 The American
