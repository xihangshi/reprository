abstract: Dielectric laser accelerators (DLAs) are fundamentally based on the interaction
  of photons with free electrons, where energy and momentum conservation are satisfied
  by mediation of a nanostructure. In this scheme, the photonic nanostructure induces
  near-fields which transfer energy from the photon to the electron, similar to the
  inverse-Smith&#x2013;Purcell effect described in metallic gratings. This, in turn,
  may provide ground-breaking applications, as it is a technology promising to miniaturize
  particle accelerators down to the chip scale. This fundamental interaction can also
  be used to study and demonstrate quantum photon-electron phenomena. The spontaneous
  and stimulated Smith&#x2013;Purcell effect and the photon-induced near-field electron-microscopy
  (PINEM) effect have evolved to be a fruitful ground for observing quantum effects.
  In particular, the energy spectrum of the free electron has been shown to have discrete
  energy peaks, spaced with the interacting photon energy. This energy spectrum is
  correlated to the photon statistics and number of photon exchanges that took place
  during the interaction. We give an overview of DLA and PINEM physics with a focus
  on electron phase-space manipulation.
