abstract: Fundamental quantum electrodynamical (QED) processes, such as spontaneous
  emission and electron-photon scattering, encompass phenomena that underlie much
  of modern science and technology. Conventionally, calculations in QED and other
  field theories treat incoming particles as single-momentum states, omitting the
  possibility that coherent superposition states, i.e., shaped wavepackets, can alter
  fundamental scattering processes. Here, we show that free electron waveshaping can
  be used to design interferences between two or more pathways in a QED process, enabling
  precise control over the rate of that process. As an example, we show that free
  electron waveshaping modifies both spatial and spectral characteristics of bremsstrahlung
  emission, leading for instance to enhancements in directionality and monochromaticity.
  The ability to tailor general QED processes opens up additional avenues of control
  in phenomena ranging from optical excitation (e.g., plasmon and phonon emission)
  in electron microscopy to free electron lasing in the quantum regime.
