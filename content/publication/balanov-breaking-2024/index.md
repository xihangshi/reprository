abstract: Parametric x-ray radiation (PXR) is a prospective mechanism for producing
  directional, tunable, and quasi-coherent x-rays in laboratory-scale dimensions,
  yet it is limited by heat dissipation and self-absorption. Resolving these limits,
  we show the PXR source flux is suitable for medical imaging and x-ray spectroscopy.
  We discuss the experimental feasibility of these findings for a compact commercial
  PXR source.
