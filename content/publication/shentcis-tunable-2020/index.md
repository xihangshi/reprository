abstract: 'Tunable sources of X-ray radiation are widely used for imaging and spectroscopy
  in fundamental science, medicine and industry. The growing demand for highly tunable,
  high-brightness laboratory-scale X-ray sources motivates research into new fundamental
  mechanisms of X-ray generation. Here, we demonstrate the ability of van der Waals
  materials to serve as a platform for tunable X-ray generation when irradiated by
  moderately relativistic electrons available, for example, from a transmission electron
  microscope. The radiation spectrum can be precisely controlled by tuning the acceleration
  voltage of the incident electrons, as well as by our proposed approach: adjusting
  the lattice structure of the van der Waals material. We present experimental results
  for both methods, observing the energy tunability of X-ray radiation from the van
  der Waals materials WSe2, CrPS4, MnPS3, FePS3, CoPS3 and NiPS3. Our findings demonstrate
  the concept of material design at the atomic level, using van der Waals heterostructures
  and other atomic superlattices, for exploring novel phenomena of X-ray physics.'
