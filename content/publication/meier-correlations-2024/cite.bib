 abstract = {When two electrons are emitted from a metal needle tip with the help of femtosecond laser pulses, they show a strong anticorrelation signal in the energy domain. Depending on the wavelength and intensity of the driving laser pulses, the electron emission process can be either in a perturbative regime, like single- or multi-photon photoemission, or in the strong-field regime, where emission is dominated by the instantaneous electric field of the laser pulse, or in the intermediate regime. Here, we report on the two-electron anticorrelation signal and how it evolves from the multiphoton toward the strong-field emission regime. We show that in both cases, the resulting anticorrelation signal can be well explained by semi-classical simulations using a point-particle model, thus the dynamics is dominated by the center-of-mass dynamics of the individual electrons. However, the actual emission process of multiple interacting electrons requires improved quantum mechanical models and therefore remains the subject of future work.
