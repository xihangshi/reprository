abstract: 'When two electrons are emitted from a metal needle tip with the help of
  femtosecond laser pulses, they show a strong anticorrelation signal in the energy
  domain. Depending on the wavelength and intensity of the driving laser pulses, the
  electron emission process can be either in a perturbative regime, like single- or
  multi-photon photoemission, or in the strong-field regime, where emission is dominated
  by the instantaneous electric field of the laser pulse, or in the intermediate regime.
  Here, we report on the two-electron anticorrelation signal and how it evolves from
  the multiphoton toward the strong-field emission regime. We show that in both cases,
  the resulting anticorrelation signal can be well explained by semi-classical simulations
  using a point-particle model, thus the dynamics is dominated by the center-of-mass
  dynamics of the individual electrons. However, the actual emission process of multiple
  interacting electrons requires improved quantum mechanical models and therefore
  remains the subject of future work.  This paper is part of the Special Topic Collection:
  papers from the 31th Annual International Laser Physics Workshop 2023 (LPHYS 2023).'
