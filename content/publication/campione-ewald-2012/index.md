abstract: We derive the Ewald representation for the dyadic periodic Green's functions
  to represent the electromagnetic field in a three dimensional (3D) periodic array
  of electric and magnetic dipoles. Then we use the developed theory to analyze the
  modes with real and complex wave number in a 3D periodic lattice of lead telluride
  (PbTe) microspheres at infrared frequencies and in a 3D periodic lattice of titanium
  dioxide (TiO2) microspheres at millimeter waves. Each microsphere is equivalently
  modeled with both an electric and a magnetic dipole, via a method here called the
  dual dipole approximation (DDA). The 3D lattices exhibit first a magnetic-induced
  then an electric-induced feature determined by microsphere magnetic and electric
  resonances. The DDA wave number results are compared to the ones computed with single
  electric or single magnetic dipole approximation and to the ones retrieved by using
  the Nicolson-Ross-Weir (NRW) retrieval method from reflection and transmission of
  finite thickness slabs computed by a full-wave simulation. It is shown that the
  DDA method is in very good agreement with NRW, in contrast to the previously reported
  single dipole approximation methods that fail to predict one of the two features
  (either electric or magnetic). A mode with transverse polarization is found to be
  dominant and able to propagate inside the lattice, and therefore the composite material
  can be treated as a homogeneous one with effective refractive index. This is obtained
  by adopting five different retrieval procedures for each lattice, and their agreement
  or disagreement is discussed.
