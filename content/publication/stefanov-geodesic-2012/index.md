abstract: We give a detailed microlocal study of X-ray transforms over geodesic-like
  families of curves with conjugate points of fold type. We show that the normal operator
  is the sum of a pseudodifferential operator and a Fourier integral operator. We
  compute the principal symbol of both operators and the canonical relation associated
  to the Fourier integral operator. In two dimensions, for the geodesic transform,
  we show that there is always a cancellation of singularities to some order, and
  we give an example where that order is infinite; therefore the normal operator is
  not microlocally invertible in that case. In the case of three dimensions or higher
  if the canonical relation is a local canonical graph we show microlocal invertibility
  of the normal operator. Several examples are also studied.
