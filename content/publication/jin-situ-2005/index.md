abstract: Electron field emission characteristics of individual multi-walled carbon
  nanotubes (MWCNTs) were investigated in situ inside the transmission electron microscope
  (TEM). For a single MWCNT it was found that while field-emission can hardly occur
  from the side of the nanotube, a curved nanotube may result in finite side emission
  and the best emission geometry is the top emission geometry. Current–voltage (I–V)
  measurements made at different vacuum conditions and voltage sweeps emphasize the
  importance of the adsorbates on the electron field emission of MWCNTs. For a contaminated
  MWCNT, although the field emission current was reduced, the stability of its emission
  was improved. A current of up to several tens of μA was observed for a single MWCNT,
  but it was found that long time emission usually results in drastic structure damage
  that may lead to sudden emission failure.
