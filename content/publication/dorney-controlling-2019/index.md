abstract: Optical interactions are governed by both spin and angular momentum conservation
  laws, which serve as a tool for controlling light–matter interactions or elucidating
  electron dynamics and structure of complex systems. Here, we uncover a form of simultaneous
  spin and orbital angular momentum conservation and show, theoretically and experimentally,
  that this phenomenon allows for unprecedented control over the divergence and polarization
  of extreme-ultraviolet vortex beams. High harmonics with spin and orbital angular
  momenta are produced, opening a novel regime of angular momentum conservation that
  allows for manipulation of the polarization of attosecond pulses—from linear to
  circular—and for the generation of circularly polarized vortices with tailored orbital
  angular momentum, including harmonic vortices with the same topological charge as
  the driving laser beam. Our work paves the way to ultrafast studies of chiral systems
  using high-harmonic beams with designer spin and orbital angular momentum.
