abstract: The coherent optical manipulation of solids is emerging as a promising way
  to engineer novel quantum states of matter. The strong time-periodic potential of
  intense laser light can be used to generate hybrid photon-electron states. Interaction
  of light with Bloch states leads to Floquet-Bloch states, which are essential in
  realizing new photo-induced quantum phases. Similarly, dressing of free-electron
  states near the surface of a solid generates Volkov states, which are used to study
  nonlinear optics in atoms and semiconductors. The interaction of these two dynamic
  states with each other remains an open experimental problem. Here we use time- and
  angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (Tr-ARPES) to selectively study the transition
  between these two states on the surface of the topological insulator Bi 2 Se 3 .
  We find that the coupling between the two strongly depends on the electron momentum,
  providing a route to enhance or inhibit it. Moreover, by controlling the light polarization
  we can negate Volkov states to generate pure Floquet-Bloch states. This work establishes
  a systematic path for the coherent manipulation of solids via light-matter interaction.
