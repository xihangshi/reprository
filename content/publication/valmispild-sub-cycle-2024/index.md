abstract: Abstract Strongly correlated solids are complex and fascinating quantum
  systems, where new electronic states continue to emerge, especially when interaction
  with light triggers interplay between them. In this interplay, a sub-laser-cycle
  electronic response is particularly attractive as a tool for the ultrafast manipulation
  of matter at the petahertz scale. Here we introduce a new type of nonlinear multidimensional
  spectroscopy, which allows us to unravel charge and energy flows in strongly correlated
  systems interacting with few-cycle infrared pulses and the complex interplay between
  different correlated states evolving on the sub-femtosecond timescale. We demonstrate
  that the sub-cycle spectroscopy of a single-particle electronic response is extremely
  sensitive to correlated many-body dynamics and provides direct access to many-body
  response functions. For the two-dimensional Hubbard model under the influence of
  ultrashort, intense electric-field transients, we resolve the sub-femtosecond pathways
  of charge and energy flows between localized and delocalized many-body states and
  the creation of a highly correlated state surviving after the end of the laser pulse.
  Our findings open the way towards a regime of imaging and manipulating strongly
  correlated materials at optical rates, beyond the multicycle approach employed in
  Floquet engineering, with the sub-cycle response being a key tool for accessing
  many-body phenomena.
