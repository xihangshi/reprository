abstract: Controlling the bandstructure through local-strain engineering is an exciting
  avenue for tailoring optoelectronic properties of materials at the nanoscale. Atomically
  thin materials are particularly well-suited for this purpose because they can withstand
  extreme nonhomogeneous deformations before rupture. Here, we study the effect of
  large localized strain in the electronic bandstructure of atomically thin MoS2.
  Using photoluminescence imaging, we observe a strain-induced reduction of the direct
  bandgap and funneling of photogenerated excitons toward regions of higher strain.
  To understand these results, we develop a nonuniform tight-binding model to calculate
  the electronic properties of MoS2 nanolayers with complex and realistic local strain
  geometries, finding good agreement with our experimental results. © 2013 American
