abstract: We theoretically demonstrate the ability of electron beams to probe the
  nonlinear photonic response with nanometer spatial resolution, well beyond the capabilities
  of existing optical techniques. Although the interaction of electron beams with
  photonic modes is generally weak, the use of optical pumping produces stimulated
  electron−light interactions that can exceed orderunity probabilities in photon-induded
  near ﬁeld electron microscopy (PINEM). Here, we demonstrate that PINEM can locally
  and quantitatively probe the nonlinear optical response. Speciﬁcally, we predict
  a dependence of PINEM electron spectra on the sample nonlinearity that can reveal
  the second-harmonic (SH) response of optical materials with nanometer resolution,
  observed through asymmetries between electron energy losses and gains. We illustrate
  this concept by showing that PINEM spectra are sensitive to the SH near ﬁeld of
  centrosymmetric structures and by ﬁnding substantial spectral asymmetries in geometries
  for which the linear interaction is reduced.
