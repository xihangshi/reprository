abstract: The radiation of uniformly moving sources, and the concomitant phenomena
  such as the Vavilov-Cherenkov effect, transition radiation, etc., are discussed.
  Since the original Lebedev Institute studies over half-century ago, this area of
  research has become an inherent part of modern physics.
