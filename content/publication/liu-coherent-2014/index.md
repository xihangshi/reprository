abstract: Although surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) resonance in graphene can be
  tuned in the terahertz regime, transforming such SPPs into coherent terahertz radiation
  has not been achieved. Here, we propose a graphene-based coherent terahertz radiation
  source with greatly enhanced intensity. The radiation works at room temperature,
  it is tunable and can cover the whole terahertz regime. The radiation intensity
  generated with this method is 400 times stronger than that from SPPs at a conventional
  dielectric or semiconducting surface and is comparable to that from the most advanced
  photonics source such as a quantum cascade laser. The physical mechanism for this
  strong radiation is presented. The phase diagrams defining the parameters range
  for the occurrence of radiation is also shown.
