abstract: The Ewald-Oseen extinction theorem is derived in a new and general form
  that is applicable to any medium. The usual form of the extinction theorem appears
  as a special case of the general formulation. It is shown that the extinction theorem
  is a consequence of the Helmholtz-Kirchhoff integral theorem.
