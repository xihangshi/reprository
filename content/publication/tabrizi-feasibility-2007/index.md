abstract: The feasibility to generate powerful monochromatic radiation of the undulator
  type in the gamma region of the spectrum by means of planar channeling of ultrarelativistic
  electrons in a periodically bent crystal is proven. It is shown that to overcome
  the restriction due to the smallness of the dechanneling length, an electron-based
  crystalline undulator must operate in the regime of higher beam energies than a
  positron-based one does. A numerical analysis is performed for a 50 GeV electron
  channeling in Si along the (111) crystallographic planes. Â© 2007 The American Physical
