 abstract = {The passage of a free-electron beam through a nanohole in a periodically layered metal-dielectric structure creates a new type of tunable, nanoscale radiation source-a "light well". In the reported demonstration, tunable light is generated at an intensity of ∼200W/cm2 as electrons with energies in the 20-40keV range are injected into gold-silica well structures with a lateral size of just a few hundred nanometers. © 2009 The American Physical Society.},
