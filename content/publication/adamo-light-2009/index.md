abstract: The passage of a free-electron beam through a nanohole in a periodically
  layered metal-dielectric structure creates a new type of tunable, nanoscale radiation
  source-a \"light well\". In the reported demonstration, tunable light is generated
  at an intensity of ∼200W/cm2 as electrons with energies in the 20-40keV range are
  injected into gold-silica well structures with a lateral size of just a few hundred
  nanometers. © 2009 The American Physical Society.
