abstract: In this paper, we derive a general expression for the excitation probability
  corresponding to the collection of inelastically scattered electrons in a scanning
  transmission electronic microscopy configuration. We prove that, if all inelastically
  scattered electrons are collected, then the fraction of electrons that will be determined
  to have given rise to excitation in a localized target at impact parameter b may
  be calculated by simply convoluting over b (1) the probability Pc(b) that a classical
  electron with the same velocity well create the excitation at given b, with (2)
  the probability of finding the electron in the microprobe at that impact parameter.
  We also show that, even in the opposite extreme, when a small solid angle of axial
  collection is employed, the energy-loss spectrum will still approximate to the classical
  expression provided that it is normalized to the same zero-loss intensity and if
  the Fourier-transformed profile function does not become too small for some ranges
  of its argument. A realistic microprobe distribution is used to compute the angular
  distribution of electrons that have created a surface plasmon or a surface optical
  phonon at a surface parallel to the electron trajectory. The results demonstrate
  the usefulness of the classical theory for axial detector positions as well as the
  possibility of enhanced spatial resolution for off-axis detector positions. Â© 1988
