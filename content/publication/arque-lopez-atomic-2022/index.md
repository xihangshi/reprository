abstract: We theoretically investigate the ability of free electrons to yield information
  on the nonlinear Floquet dynamics of atomic systems subject to intense external
  illumination. By applying a quantum-mechanical formalism to describe the atom-electron
  interaction under the presence of a monochromatic classical light field, we observe
  multiple energy features that reveal a large departure from nonillumination conditions
  in two- and three-level illuminated atoms, including the emergence of energy features
  associated with direct photon absorption and emission by the electron, as well as
  a varied set of Floquet resonances that strongly depend on the light intensity and
  frequency. Our results unveil a wealth of effects associated with the interaction
  between free electrons and optically driven electronic systems.
