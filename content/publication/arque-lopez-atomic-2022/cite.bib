 abstract = {We theoretically investigate the ability of free electrons to yield information on the nonlinear Floquet dynamics of atomic systems subject to intense external illumination. By applying a quantum-mechanical formalism to describe the atom-electron interaction under the presence of a monochromatic classical light field, we observe multiple energy features that reveal a large departure from nonillumination conditions in two- and three-level illuminated atoms, including the emergence of energy features associated with direct photon absorption and emission by the electron, as well as a varied set of Floquet resonances that strongly depend on the light intensity and frequency. Our results unveil a wealth of effects associated with the interaction between free electrons and optically driven electronic systems.},
