abstract: 'We present the quantum theory governing the interaction between short laser
  pulses and relativistic free electrons and reveal intrinsic conservation laws for
  such quantum interactions. Through the judicious design of the amplitude and phase
  of a laser pulse, we propose the complete shaping of the electron temporal wavepacket
  and energy spectrum. To exemplify the prospects and limitations of the shaping process,
  we optimize laser pulses that can reduce the energy spread of an electron beam.
  We also ﬁnd attosecond laser pulse trains that generate electron combs with record
  short attosecond features that push the lowest limits of electron temporal duration.
  We propose to utilize the quantum shaping of the electron energy spectrum for a
  new kind of light−matter interaction: Matching the shaped electron energy shift
  to a target material excitation. This way we can transfer the electron coherent
  state into a new coherent material excitation, allowing access to states that are
  forbidden with optical excitations. Our formalism generalizes all the previous theoretical
  models in the area of photon-induced nearﬁeld electron microscopy (PINEM); our formalism
  can ﬁt experiments in the ﬁeld that cannot be modeled by the conventional PINEM
  theory. Altogether, our new formalism of shaping quantum electron-laser interactions
  in the dimension of time/energy has prospects for novel phenomena in attosecond
  science, for new techniques in electron microscopy, and for their potential marriage
  in ultrafast quantum electron optics.'
