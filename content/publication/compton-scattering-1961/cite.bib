 abstract = {The experimental evidence and the theoretical considerations that led to the discovery and interpretation of the modification of the wavelength of x rays as a result of scattering by electrons are reviewed, as is the controversy between Duane and the author that took place in 1923â€“24. The confirmatory evidence obtained by Bothe, Geiger, Simon, and Compton is summarized.},
