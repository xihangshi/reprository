abstract: The experimental evidence and the theoretical considerations that led to
  the discovery and interpretation of the modification of the wavelength of x rays
  as a result of scattering by electrons are reviewed, as is the controversy between
  Duane and the author that took place in 1923â€“24. The confirmatory evidence obtained
  by Bothe, Geiger, Simon, and Compton is summarized.
