 abstract = {This review concerns radiative phenomena accompanying the passage of charged relativistic particles and high-energy photons through periodic media. Radiative processes related to the uniform motion or Coulomb scattering of relativistic particles are discussed. The results obtained in this field are widely used in current physical research in such areas as high-energy physics, solid-state physics, technology development, and apparatus design.},
