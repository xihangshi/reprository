abstract: To be useful for most scientific and medical applications, compact particle
  accelerators will require much higher average current than enabled by current architectures.
  For this purpose, we propose a photonic crystal architecture for a dielectric laser
  accelerator, referred to as a multi-input multi-output silicon accelerator (MIMOSA),
  that enables simultaneous acceleration of multiple electron beams, increasing the
  total electron throughput by at least 1 order of magnitude. To achieve this, we
  show that the photonic crystal must support a mode at the &#x0393; point in reciprocal
  space, with a normalized frequency equal to the normalized speed of the phase-matched
  electron. We show that the figure of merit of the MIMOSA can be inferred from the
  eigenmodes of the corresponding infinitely periodic structure, which provides a
  powerful approach to design such devices. Additionally, we extend the MIMOSA architecture
  to electron deflectors and other electron manipulation functionalities. These additional
  functionalities, combined with the increased electron throughput of these devices,
  permit all-optical on-chip manipulation of electron beams in a fully integrated
  architecture compatible with current fabrication technologies, which opens the way
  to unconventional electron beam shaping, imaging, and radiation generation.
