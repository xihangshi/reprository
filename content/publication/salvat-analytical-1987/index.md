abstract: An analytical approximation, depending on five parameters, for the atomic
  screening function is proposed. The corresponding electrostatic potential takes
  a simple analytical form (superposition of three Yukawa potentials) well suited
  to most practical applications. Parameters in the screening function, determined
  by an analytical fitting procedure to Dirac-Hartree-Fock-Slater (DHFS) self-consistent
  data, are given for Z=192. The reliability of this analytical approach is demonstrated
  by showing that (a) Born cross sections for elastic scattering of fast charged particles
  by the present analytical field and by the DHFS field practically coincide and (b)
  one-electron binding energies computed from the independent-particle model with
  our analytical field (corrected for exchange and electrostatic self-interaction)
  agree closely with the DHFS energy eigenvalues. Â© 1987 The American Physical Society.
