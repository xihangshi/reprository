abstract: The recent development of ultrafast extreme ultraviolet (XUV) coherent light
  sources bears great potential for a better understanding of the structure and dynamics
  of matter. Promising routes are advanced coherent control and nonlinear spectroscopy
  schemes in the XUV energy range, yielding unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution.
  However, their implementation has been hampered by the experimental challenge of
  generating XUV pulse sequences with precisely controlled timing and phase properties.
  In particular, direct control and manipulation of the phase of individual pulses
  within an XUV pulse sequence opens exciting possibilities for coherent control and
  multidimensional spectroscopy, but has not been accomplished. Here, we overcome
  these constraints in a highly time-stabilized and phase-modulated XUV-pump, XUV-probe
  experiment, which directly probes the evolution and dephasing of an inner subshell
  electronic coherence. This approach, avoiding any XUV optics for direct pulse manipulation,
  opens up extensive applications of advanced nonlinear optics and spectroscopy at
  XUV wavelengths.
