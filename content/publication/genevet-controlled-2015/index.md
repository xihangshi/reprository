abstract: In the Cherenkov effect a charged particle moving with a velocity faster
  than the phase velocity of light in the medium radiates light that forms a cone
  with a half angle determined by the ratio of the two speeds. Here, we show that
  by creating a running wave of polarization along a one-dimensional metallic nanostructure
  consisting of subwavelength-spaced rotated apertures that propagates faster than
  the surface plasmon polariton phase velocity, we can generate surface plasmon wakes,
  a two-dimensional analogue of Cherenkov radiation. The running wave of polarization
  travels with a speed determined by the angle of incidence and the photon spin angular
  momentum of the incident radiation. By changing either one of these properties we
  demonstrate controlled steering of the Cherenkov surface plasmon wakes.
