abstract: Further enhancement of the intense coherent superradiant and stimulated-superradiant
  emission from prebunched electron beams is possible, in schemes of prebunched beam
  radiation devices, and particularly free electron laser (FEL). The enhancement of
  coherent power and spectral power by use of a waveguide, particularly at the zero-slippage
  condition, is evaluated. A special scheme of a stimulated-superradiance FEL oscillator
  is analyzed and is shown to feature ultimate radiative energy conversion efficiency
  (near 100%). Â© 2005 The American Physical Society.
