 abstract = {Further enhancement of the intense coherent superradiant and stimulated-superradiant emission from prebunched electron beams is possible, in schemes of prebunched beam radiation devices, and particularly free electron laser (FEL). The enhancement of coherent power and spectral power by use of a waveguide, particularly at the zero-slippage condition, is evaluated. A special scheme of a stimulated-superradiance FEL oscillator is analyzed and is shown to feature ultimate radiative energy conversion efficiency (near 100%). Â© 2005 The American Physical Society.},
