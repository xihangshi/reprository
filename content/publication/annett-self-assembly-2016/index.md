abstract: Graphene and related two-dimensional materials have shown unusual and exceptional
  mechanical properties, with similarities to origami-like paper folding and kirigami-like
  cutting demonstrated. For paper analogues, a critical difference between macroscopic
  sheets and a two-dimensional solid is the molecular scale of the thin dimension
  of the latter, allowing the thermal activation of considerable out-of-plane motion.
  So far thermal activity has been shown to produce local wrinkles in a free graphene
  sheet that help in theoretically understanding its stability, for example, and give
  rise to unexpected long-range bending stiffness. Here we show that thermal activation
  can have a more marked effect on the behaviour of two-dimensional solids, leading
  to spontaneous and self-driven sliding, tearing and peeling from a substrate on
  scales approaching the macroscopic. We demonstrate that scalable nanoimprint-style
  contact techniques can nucleate and direct the parallel self-assembly of graphene
  ribbons of controlled shape in ambient conditions. We interpret our observations
  through a simple fracture-mechanics model that shows how thermodynamic forces drive
  the formation of the graphene-graphene interface in lieu of substrate contact with
  sufficient strength to peel and tear multilayer graphene sheets. Our results show
  how weak physical surface forces can be harnessed and focused by simple folded configurations
  of graphene to tear the strongest covalent bond. This effect may hold promise for
  the patterning and mechanical actuating of devices based on two-dimensional materials.
