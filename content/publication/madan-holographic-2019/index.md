abstract: Holography relies on the interference between a known reference and a signal
  of interest to reconstruct both the amplitude and the phase of that signal. With
  electrons, the extension of holography to the ultrafast time domain remains a challenge,
  although it would yield the highest possible combined spatiotemporal resolution.
  Here, we show that holograms of local electromagnetic fields can be obtained with
  combined attosecond/nanometer resolution in an ultrafast transmission electron microscope
  (UEM). Unlike conventional holography, where signal and reference are spatially
  separated and then recombined to interfere, our method relies on electromagnetic
  fields to split an electron wave function in a quantum coherent superposition of
  different energy states. In the image plane, spatial modulation of the electron
  energy distribution reflects the phase relation between reference and signal fields.
  Beyond imaging applications, this approach allows implementing quantum measurements
  in parallel, providing an efficient and versatile tool for electron quantum optics.
