abstract: An approach is developed for the continuous fabrication of lateral multi-junction
  heterostructures of transition-metal dichalcogenides, in which the sequential formation
  of heterojunctions is achieved solely by changing the composition of the reactive
  gas environment in the presence of water vapour.
