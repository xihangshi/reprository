abstract: Layered systems of 2D crystals and heterostructures are widely explored
  for new physics and devices. In many cases, monolayer or few-layer 2D crystals are
  transferred to a target substrate including other 2D crystals, and nanometer-scale
  blisters form spontaneously between the 2D crystal and its substrate. Such nanoblisters
  are often recognized as an indicator of good adhesion, but there is no consensus
  on the contents inside the blisters. While gas-filled blisters have been modeled
  and measured by bulge tests, applying such models to spontaneously formed nanoblisters
  yielded unrealistically low adhesion energy values between the 2D crystal and its
  substrate. Typically, gas-filled blisters are fully deflated within hours or days.
  In contrast, we found that the height of the spontaneously formed nanoblisters dropped
  only by 20â€“30% after 3 mo, indicating that probably liquid instead of gas is trapped
  in them. We therefore developed a simple scaling law and a rigorous theoretical
  model for liquid-filled nanoblisters, which predicts that the interfacial work of
  adhesion is related to the fourth power of the aspect ratio of the nanoblister and
  depends on the surface tension of the liquid. Our model was verified by molecular
  dynamics simulations, and the adhesion energy values obtained for the measured nanoblisters
  are in good agreement with those reported in the literature. This model can be applied
  to estimate the pressure inside the nanoblisters and the work of adhesion for a
  variety of 2D interfaces, which provides important implications for the fabrication
  and deformability of 2D heterostructures and devices.
