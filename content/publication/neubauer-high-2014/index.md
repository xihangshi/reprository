abstract: We report on the fabrication and characterization of hard x-ray waveguide
  channels manufactured by e-beam lithography, reactive ion etching and wafer bonding.
  The guiding layer consists of air or vacuum and the cladding material of silicon,
  which is favorable in view of minimizing absorption losses. The specifications for
  waveguide channels which have to be met in the hard x-ray range to achieve a suitable
  beam confinement in two orthogonal directions are extremely demanding. First, high
  aspect ratios up to 106 have to be achieved between lateral structure size and length
  of the guides. Second, the channels have to be deeply embedded in material to warrant
  the guiding of the desired modes while absorbing all other (radiative) modes in
  the cladding material. We give a detailed report on device fabrication with the
  respective protocols and parameter optimization, the inspection and the optical
  characterization.
