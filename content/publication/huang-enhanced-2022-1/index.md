abstract: Abstract Van der Waals (vdW) materials have attracted much interest for
  their myriad unique electronic, mechanical, and thermal properties. In particular,
  they are promising candidates for monochromatic, table-top X-ray sources. This work
  reveals that the versatility of the table-top vdW X-ray source goes beyond what
  has been demonstrated so far. By introducing a tilt angle between the vdW structure
  and the incident electron beam, it is theoretically and experimentally shown that
  the accessible photon energy range is more than doubled. This allows for greater
  versatility in real-time tuning of the vdW X-ray source. Furthermore, this work
  shows that the accessible photon energy range is maximized by simultaneously controlling
  both the electron energy and the vdW structure tilt. These results will pave the
  way for highly tunable, compact X-ray sources, with potential applications including
  hyperspectral X-ray fluoroscopy and X-ray quantumÂ optics.
