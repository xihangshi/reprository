abstract: Axial coherent bremsstrahlung of type A (ACBA) has not been intensively
  investigated either theoretically or experimentally. Making use of the many-beam
  (two-dimensional quantum treatment) formalism for transversely bound electrons moving
  through crystal lattices, we have computed ACBA spectra for 17 MeV electrons passing
  through a 10 μm thick diamond (C) crystal. We found that the momentum transfer occurs
  in the plane perpendicular to the axis of interest. Only momentum transfers along
  the scan direction (electron transverse momentum direction) result in a photon emission
  in the forward direction. Two different scans have shown that the energies of the
  coherent bremsstrahlung peaks depend strongly on the direction of the electron transverse
  momentum. We also present a comparison of the first order Born approximation and
  the many-beam formalism.
