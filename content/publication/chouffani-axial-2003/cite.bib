 abstract = {Axial coherent bremsstrahlung of type A (ACBA) has not been intensively investigated either theoretically or experimentally. Making use of the many-beam (two-dimensional quantum treatment) formalism for transversely bound electrons moving through crystal lattices, we have computed ACBA spectra for 17 MeV electrons passing through a 10 μm thick diamond (C) crystal. We found that the momentum transfer occurs in the plane perpendicular to the axis of interest. Only momentum transfers along the scan direction (electron transverse momentum direction) result in a photon emission in the forward direction. Two different scans have shown that the energies of the coherent bremsstrahlung peaks depend strongly on the direction of the electron transverse momentum. We also present a comparison of the first order Born approximation and the many-beam formalism.},
