abstract: We present the experimental synthesis of one-dimensional (1D) van der Waals
  heterostructures, a class of materials where different atomic layers are coaxially
  stacked. We demonstrate the growth of single-crystal layers of hexagonal boron nitride
  (BN) and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) crystals on single-walled carbon nanotubes
  (SWCNTs). For the latter, larger-diameter nanotubes that overcome strain effect
  were more readily synthesized. We also report a 5-nanometer-diameter heterostructure
  consisting of an inner SWCNT, a middle three-layer BN nanotube, and an outer MoS2
  nanotube. Electron diffraction verifies that all shells in the heterostructures
  are single crystals. This work suggests that all of the materials in the current
  2D library could be rolled into their 1D counterparts and a plethora of function-designable
  1D heterostructures could be realized.
