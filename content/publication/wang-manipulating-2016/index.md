abstract: Swift electrons moving closely parallel to a periodic grating produce far-field
  radiation of light, which is known as the Smith-Purcell effect. In this letter,
  we demonstrate that designer Babinet metasurfaces composed of C-aperture resonators
  offer a powerful control over the polarization state of the Smith-Purcell emission,
  which can hardly be achieved via traditional gratings. By coupling the intrinsically
  nonradiative energy bound at the source current sheet to the out-of-plane electric
  dipole and in-plane magnetic dipole of the C-aperture resonator, we are able to
  excite cross-polarized light thanks to the bianisotropic nature of the metasurface.
  The polarization direction of the emitted light is aligned with the orientation
  of the C-aperture resonator. Furthermore, the efficiency of the Smith-Purcell emission
  from Babinet metasurfaces is significantly increased by 84%, in comparison with
  the case of conventional gratings. These findings not only open up a new way to
  manipulate the electron-beam-induced emission in the near-field region but also
  promise compact, tunable, and efficient light sources and particle detectors.
