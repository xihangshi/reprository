abstract: Strong electron-photon interactions occurring in a dielectric laser accelerator
  provide the potential for development of a compact electron accelerator. Theoretically,
  metallic materials exhibiting notable surface plasmon-field enhancements can possibly
  generate a high electron acceleration capability. Here, we present a design for
  metallic material-based on-chip laser-driven accelerators that show a remarkable
  electron acceleration capability, as demonstrated in ultrafast electron microscopy
  investigations. Under phase-matching conditions, efficient and continuous acceleration
  of free electrons on a periodic nanostructure can be achieved. Importantly, an asymmetric
  spectral structure in which the vast majority of the electrons are in the energy-gain
  states has been obtained by means of a periodic bowtie-structure accelerator. Due
  to the presence of surface plasmon enhancement and nonlinear optical effects, the
  maximum acceleration gradient can reach as high as 0.335 GeV/m. This demonstrates
  that metallic laser accelerator could provide a way to develop compact accelerators
  on chip.
