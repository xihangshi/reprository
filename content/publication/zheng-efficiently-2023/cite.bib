 abstract = {Strong electron-photon interactions occurring in a dielectric laser accelerator provide the potential for development of a compact electron accelerator. Theoretically, metallic materials exhibiting notable surface plasmon-field enhancements can possibly generate a high electron acceleration capability. Here, we present a design for metallic material-based on-chip laser-driven accelerators that show a remarkable electron acceleration capability, as demonstrated in ultrafast electron microscopy investigations. Under phase-matching conditions, efficient and continuous acceleration of free electrons on a periodic nanostructure can be achieved. Importantly, an asymmetric spectral structure in which the vast majority of the electrons are in the energy-gain states has been obtained by means of a periodic bowtie-structure accelerator. Due to the presence of surface plasmon enhancement and nonlinear optical effects, the maximum acceleration gradient can reach as high as 0.335 GeV/m. This demonstrates that metallic laser accelerator could provide a way to develop compact accelerators on chip.},
