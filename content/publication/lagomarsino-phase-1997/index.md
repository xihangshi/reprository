abstract: In this letter we present a hard x-ray phase contrast microscope based on
  the divergent and coherent beam exiting an x-ray waveguide. It uses lensless geometrical
  projection to magnify spatial variations in optical path length more than 700 times.
  Images of a nylon fiber and a gold test pattern were obtained with a resolution
  of 0.14 μm in one direction. Exposure times as short as 0.1 s gave already visible
  contrast, opening the way to high resolution, real time studies.
