abstract: Learn about the latest advances in high-brightness X-ray physics and technology
  with this authoritative text. Drawing upon the most recent theoretical developments,
  pre-eminent leaders in the field guide readers through the fundamental principles
  and techniques of high-brightness X-ray generation from both synchrotron and free-electron
  laser sources. A wide range of topics is covered, including high-brightness synchrotron
  radiation from undulators, self-amplified spontaneous emission, seeded high-gain
  amplifiers with harmonic generation, ultra-short pulses, tapering for higher power,
  free-electron laser oscillators, and X-ray oscillator and amplifier configuration.
  Novel mathematical approaches and numerous figures accompanied by intuitive explanations
  enable easy understanding of key concepts, whilst practical considerations of performance-improving
  techniques and discussion of recent experimental results provide the tools and knowledge
  needed to address current research problems in the field. This is a comprehensive
  resource for graduate students, researchers and practitioners who design, manage
  or use X-ray facilities.
