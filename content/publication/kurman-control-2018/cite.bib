 abstract = {Light emission and absorption is fundamentally a joint property of both an emitter and its optical environment. Nevertheless, because of the much smaller momenta of photons compared with electrons at similar energies, the optical environment typically modifies only the emission/absorption rates, leaving the emitter transition frequencies practically an intrinsic property. We show here that surface polaritons, exemplified by graphene plasmons, but also valid for other types of polariton, enable substantial and tunable control of the transition frequencies of a nearby quantum well, demonstrating a sharp break with the emitter-centric view. Central to this result is the large momenta of surface polaritons that can approach the momenta of electrons and impart a pronounced non-local behaviour to the quantum well. This work facilitates non-vertical optical transitions in solids and empowers ongoing efforts to access such transitions in indirect-bandgap materials, such as silicon, as well as enriching the study of non-locality in photonics.},
