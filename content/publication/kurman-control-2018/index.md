abstract: Light emission and absorption is fundamentally a joint property of both
  an emitter and its optical environment. Nevertheless, because of the much smaller
  momenta of photons compared with electrons at similar energies, the optical environment
  typically modifies only the emission/absorption rates, leaving the emitter transition
  frequencies practically an intrinsic property. We show here that surface polaritons,
  exemplified by graphene plasmons, but also valid for other types of polariton, enable
  substantial and tunable control of the transition frequencies of a nearby quantum
  well, demonstrating a sharp break with the emitter-centric view. Central to this
  result is the large momenta of surface polaritons that can approach the momenta
  of electrons and impart a pronounced non-local behaviour to the quantum well. This
  work facilitates non-vertical optical transitions in solids and empowers ongoing
  efforts to access such transitions in indirect-bandgap materials, such as silicon,
  as well as enriching the study of non-locality in photonics.
