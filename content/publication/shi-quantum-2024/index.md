abstract: 
  Rapid progress in precision nanofabrication and atomic design over the past 50 years has ushered in a 
  succession of transformative eras for molding the generation and flow of light. The use of nanoscale and atomic features to design light sources and optical elements-encapsulated by the term nanophotonics-has led to new fundamental science and innovative technologies across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, with substantial emphasis on the microwave to visible regimes. In this review, we pay special attention to the impact and potential of nanophotonics in a relatively exotic yet technologically disruptive regime: high-energy particles such as X-ray photons and free electrons-where nanostructures and atomic design open the doors to unprecedented technologies in quantum science and versatile X-ray sources and optics. As the practical generation of X-rays is intrinsically linked to the existence of energetic free or quasi-free-electrons, our review will also capture related phenomena and technologies that combine free electrons with nanophotonics, including free-electron-driven nanophotonics at other photon energies. In particular, we delve into the demonstration and study of quantum recoil in the X-ray regime, the study of nanomaterial design and free-electron wave shaping as means to enhance and control X-ray radiation, examine the free-electron generation enabled by nanophotonics, and analyze the high-harmonic generation by quasi-free electrons. We also discuss applications of quantum nanophotonics for X-rays and free electrons, including nanostructure waveguides for X-rays, photon pair enhanced X-ray imaging, mirrors, and lenses for X-rays, among others.
