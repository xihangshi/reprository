abstract: Abstract In electron microscopy, detailed insights into nanoscale optical
  properties of materials are gained by spontaneous inelastic scattering leading to
  electron-energy loss and cathodoluminescence. Stimulated scattering in the presence
  of external sample excitation allows for mode- and polarization-selective photon-induced
  near-field electron microscopy (PINEM). This process imprints a spatial phase profile
  inherited from the optical fields onto the wave function of the probing electrons.
  Here, we introduce Lorentz-PINEM for the full-field, non-invasive imaging of complex
  optical near fields at high spatial resolution. We use energy-filtered defocus phase-contrast
  imaging and iterative phase retrieval to reconstruct the phase distribution of interfering
  surface-bound modes on a plasmonic nanotip. Our approach is universally applicable
  to retrieve the spatially varying phase of nanoscale fields and topological modes.
