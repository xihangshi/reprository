abstract: A method to compute the excitation of narrow transitions at hard x-ray energies
  by short focused x-ray pulses is developed. In particular, the effect of thin-film
  cavities on the pulse propagation is incorporated via a semi-analytical algorithm
  requiring the numerical evaluation of only one two-dimensional Fourier transform.
  We investigate various limiting cases to confirm the reliability of the algorithm.
  As an application, we show how a focused x-ray pulse propagates in cavity structures
  utilized in previous theoretical studies and experiments with collimated beams.
