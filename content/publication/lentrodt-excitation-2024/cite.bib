 abstract = {A method to compute the excitation of narrow transitions at hard x-ray energies by short focused x-ray pulses is developed. In particular, the effect of thin-film cavities on the pulse propagation is incorporated via a semi-analytical algorithm requiring the numerical evaluation of only one two-dimensional Fourier transform. We investigate various limiting cases to confirm the reliability of the algorithm. As an application, we show how a focused x-ray pulse propagates in cavity structures utilized in previous theoretical studies and experiments with collimated beams.},
