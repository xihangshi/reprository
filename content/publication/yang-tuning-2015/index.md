abstract: Creating materials with ultimate control over their physical properties
  is vital for a wide range of applications. From a traditional materials design perspective,
  this task often requires precise control over the atomic composition and structure.
  However, owing to their mechanical properties, low-dimensional layered materials
  can actually withstand a significant amount of strain and thus sustain elastic deformations
  before fracture. This, in return, presents a unique technique for tuning their physical
  properties by \"strain engineering\". Here, we find that local strain induced on
  ReSe2, a new member of the transition metal dichalcogenides family, greatly changes
  its magnetic, optical, and electrical properties. Local strain induced by generation
  of wrinkle (1) modulates the optical gap as evidenced by red-shifted photoluminescence
  peak, (2) enhances light emission, (3) induces magnetism, and (4) modulates the
  electrical properties. The results not only allow us to create materials with vastly
  different properties at the nanoscale, but also enable a wide range of applications
  based on 2D materials, including strain sensors, stretchable electrodes, flexible
  field-effect transistors, artificial-muscle actuators, solar cells, and other spintronic,
  electromechanical, piezoelectric, photonic devices.
