 abstract = {Polarization properties of parametric x radiation (PXR) produced by E0 = 80.5 MeV electrons interacting with a 13 μm thick silicon crystal have been investigated. The direction and the degree of the linear polarization of PXR observed at about 20° with respect to the electron beam direction were determined by means of a novel method exploiting directional information of the photoelectric effect in a charge coupled device consisting of 6.8 × 6.8 μm pixels. Comparison of the results with a newly derived theoretical expression exhibits very good agreement if on top of the basic interaction process underlying PXR effects decreasing the polarization are taken into account. © 1997 The American Physical Society.},
