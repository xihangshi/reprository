abstract: Polarization properties of parametric x radiation (PXR) produced by E0 =
  80.5 MeV electrons interacting with a 13 μm thick silicon crystal have been investigated.
  The direction and the degree of the linear polarization of PXR observed at about
  20° with respect to the electron beam direction were determined by means of a novel
  method exploiting directional information of the photoelectric effect in a charge
  coupled device consisting of 6.8 × 6.8 μm pixels. Comparison of the results with
  a newly derived theoretical expression exhibits very good agreement if on top of
  the basic interaction process underlying PXR effects decreasing the polarization
  are taken into account. © 1997 The American Physical Society.
