 abstract = {In ultrafast spectroscopy, the temporal resolution of time-resolved experiments depends on the duration of the pump and probe pulses, and on the control and characterization of their relative synchronization. Free-electron lasers operating in the extreme ultraviolet and X-ray spectral regions deliver pulses with femtosecond and attosecond duration in a broad array of pump–probe configurations to study a wide range of physical processes. However, this flexibility, together with the large dimensions and high complexity of the experimental set-ups, limits control of the temporal delay to the femtosecond domain, thus precluding a time resolution below the optical cycle. Here we demonstrate a novel single-shot technique able to determine the relative synchronization between an attosecond pulse train—generated by a seeded free-electron laser—and the optical oscillations of a near-infrared field, with a resolution of one atomic unit (24 as). Using this attosecond timing tool, we report the first example of attosecond coherent control of photoionization in a two-colour field by manipulating the phase of high-order near-infrared transitions.},
