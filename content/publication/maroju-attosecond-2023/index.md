abstract: In ultrafast spectroscopy, the temporal resolution of time-resolved experiments
  depends on the duration of the pump and probe pulses, and on the control and characterization
  of their relative synchronization. Free-electron lasers operating in the extreme
  ultraviolet and X-ray spectral regions deliver pulses with femtosecond and attosecond
  duration in a broad array of pump–probe configurations to study a wide range of
  physical processes. However, this flexibility, together with the large dimensions
  and high complexity of the experimental set-ups, limits control of the temporal
  delay to the femtosecond domain, thus precluding a time resolution below the optical
  cycle. Here we demonstrate a novel single-shot technique able to determine the relative
  synchronization between an attosecond pulse train—generated by a seeded free-electron
  laser—and the optical oscillations of a near-infrared field, with a resolution of
  one atomic unit (24 as). Using this attosecond timing tool, we report the first
  example of attosecond coherent control of photoionization in a two-colour field
  by manipulating the phase of high-order near-infrared transitions.
