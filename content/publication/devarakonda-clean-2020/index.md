abstract: Advances in low-dimensional superconductivity are often realized through
  improvements in material quality. Apart from a small group of organic materials,
  there is a near absence of clean-limit two-dimensional (2D) superconductors, which
  presents an impediment to the pursuit of numerous long-standing predictions for
  exotic superconductivity with fragile pairing symmetries. We developed a bulk superlattice
  consisting of the transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) superconductor 2H-niobium
  disulfide (2H-NbS2) and a commensurate block layer that yields enhanced two-dimensionality,
  high electronic quality, and clean-limit inorganic 2D superconductivity. The structure
  of this material may naturally be extended to generate a distinct family of 2D superconductors,
  topological insulators, and excitonic systems based on TMDs with improved material
  properties.
