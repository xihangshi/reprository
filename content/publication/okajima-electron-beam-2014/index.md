abstract: We have numerically analyzed, based on a simplified particle-in-cell finite-difference
  time-domain (PIC-FDTD) method, an electron-beam (e-beam) induced terahertz (THz)
  radiation from metallic grating structures with graded depths (graded grating).
  Upon exciting with e-beam, directional THz radiations with wide-band spectrum containing
  several sharp peaks are obtained only from the one of the edge of the grating, which
  cannot be expected from the conventional theory of Smith-Purcell radiation. It was
  clarified that each modes originate from different locations on the graded grating
  reflecting different dispersion characteristics of spoof surface plasmon polariton
  (spoof SPP) at each locations, and they can propagate toward only the shallower
  groove as a surface wave due to the cutoff at each locations, and all of these modes
  eventually emitted from the one of the edge of the graded grating. These directional
  radiations can be directed toward either backward or forward by making the groove
  depth deeper or shallower. The lowest and the highest frequency of the radiation
  can be chosen by appropriately designing the deepest and the shallowest groove depths,
  respectively. These unique radiations cannot be obtained from the uniformly grooved
  grating. Our findings may open the way for a development of novel THz radiation
  source based on the spoof SPP on the wide variety of metallic grating structures
  or metasurfaces.
