abstract: Van der Waals heterostructures have emerged as promising building blocks
  that offer access to new physics, novel device functionalities and superior electrical
  and optoelectronic properties1–7. Applications such as thermal management, photodetection,
  light emission, data communication, high-speed electronics and light harvesting8–16require
  a thorough understanding of (nanoscale) heat flow. Here, using time-resolved photocurrent
  measurements, we identify an efficient out-of-plane energy transfer channel, where
  charge carriers in graphene couple to hyperbolic phonon polaritons17–19in the encapsulating
  layered material. This hyperbolic cooling is particularly efficient, giving picosecond
  cooling times for hexagonal BN, where the high-momentum hyperbolic phonon polaritons
  enable efficient near-field energy transfer. We study this heat transfer mechanism
  using distinct control knobs to vary carrier density and lattice temperature, and
  find excellent agreement with theory without any adjustable parameters. These insights
  may lead to the ability to control heat flow in van der Waals heterostructures.
