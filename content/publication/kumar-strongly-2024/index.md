abstract: Strongly correlated electron systems are a cornerstone of modern physics,
  being responsible for groundbreaking phenomena from superconducting magnets to quantum
  computing. In most cases, correlations in electrons arise exclusively because of
  Coulomb interactions. In this work, we reveal that free electrons interacting simultaneously
  with a light field can become highly correlated via mechanisms beyond Coulomb interactions.
  In the case of two electrons, the resulting Pearson correlation coefficient for
  the joint probability distribution of the output electron energies is enhanced by
  more than 13 orders of magnitude compared to that of electrons interacting with
  the light field in succession (one after another). These highly correlated electrons
  are the result of momentum and energy exchange between the participating electrons
  via the external quantum light field. Our findings pave the way to the creation
  and control of highly correlated free electrons for applications including quantum
  information and ultrafast imaging. ,  Many electrons interacting with quantum light
  can become highly correlated in energy even in the absence of Coulomb repulsion.
