abstract: Revealing how 2D plasmons emerge and evolve in electron energy?loss spectroscopy
  (EELS). Launching of plasmons by swift electrons has long been used in electron
  energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) to investigate the plasmonic properties of ultrathin,
  or two-dimensional (2D), electron systems. However, the question of how a swift
  electron generates plasmons in space and time has never been answered. We address
  this issue by calculating and demonstrating the spatial-temporal dynamics of 2D
  plasmon generation in graphene. We predict a jet-like rise of excessive charge concentration
  that delays the generation of 2D plasmons in EELS, exhibiting an analog to the hydrodynamic
  Rayleigh jet in a splashing phenomenon before the launching of ripples. The photon
  radiation, analogous to the splashing sound, accompanies the plasmon emission and
  can be understood as being shaken off by the Rayleigh jet?like charge concentration.
  Considering this newly revealed process, we argue that previous estimates on the
  yields of graphene plasmons in EELS need to be reevaluated.
