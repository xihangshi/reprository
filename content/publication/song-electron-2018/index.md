abstract: In recent decades, scientists have developed the means to engineer synthetic
  periodic arrays with feature sizes below the wavelength of light. When such features
  are appropriately structured, electromagnetic radiation can be manipulated in unusual
  ways, resulting in optical metamaterials whose function is directly controlled through
  nanoscale structure. Nature, too, has adopted such techniques—for example in the
  unique colouring of butterfly wings—to manipulate photons as they propagate through
  nanoscale periodic assemblies. In this Perspective, we highlight the intriguing
  potential of designer structuring of electronic matter at scales at and below the
  electron wavelength, which affords a new range of synthetic quantum metamaterials
  with unconventional responses. Driven by experimental developments in stacking atomically
  layered heterostructures—such as mechanical pick-up/transfer assembly—atomic-scale
  registrations and structures can be readily tuned over distances smaller than characteristic
  electronic length scales (such as the electron wavelength, screening length and
  electron mean free path). Yet electronic metamaterials promise far richer categories
  of behaviour than those found in conventional optical metamaterial technologies.
  This is because, unlike photons, which scarcely interact with each other, electrons
  in subwavelength-structured metamaterials are charged and strongly interact. As
  a result, an enormous variety of emergent phenomena can be expected and radically
  new classes of interacting quantum metamaterials designed.
