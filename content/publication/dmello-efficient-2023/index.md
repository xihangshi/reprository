abstract: Laser light can modulate the kinetic energy spectrum of free electrons and
  induce extremely high acceleration gradients, which are instrumental to electron
  microscopy and electron acceleration, respectively. We present a design scheme for
  a silicon photonic slot waveguide which hosts a supermode to interact with free
  electrons. The efficiency of this interaction relies on the coupling strength per
  photon along the interaction length. We predict an optimum value of 0.4266, resulting
  in the maximum energy gain of 28.27 keV for an optical pulse energy of only 0.22
  nJ and duration 1 ps. The acceleration gradient is 1.05&#x2005;GeV/m, which is lower
  than the maximum imposed by the damage threshold of Si waveguides. Our scheme shows
  how the coupling efficiency and energy gain can be maximized without maximizing
  the acceleration gradient. It highlights the potential of silicon photonics technology
  in hosting electron-photon interactions with direct applications in free-electron
  acceleration, radiation sources, and quantum information science.
