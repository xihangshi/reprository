 abstract = {We have fabricated linear tapered waveguide channels filled with air and imbedded in silicon for the hard x-ray regime, using a processing scheme involving e-beam lithography, reactive ion etching, and wafer bonding. Beam compression in such channels is demonstrated by coupling a pre-focused undulator beam into the channels, and recording the exit flux and far-field diffraction patterns. We achieved a compressed beam with a spot size of 16.48 nm (horizontal) Ã— 14.6 nm (vertical) near the waveguide exit plane, as determined from the reconstructed near-field distribution, at an exit flux which is eight times higher than that of an equivalent straight channel. Simulations indicate that this gain could reach three to four orders of magnitude for longer channels with tapering in two directions.},
