abstract: We have fabricated linear tapered waveguide channels filled with air and
  imbedded in silicon for the hard x-ray regime, using a processing scheme involving
  e-beam lithography, reactive ion etching, and wafer bonding. Beam compression in
  such channels is demonstrated by coupling a pre-focused undulator beam into the
  channels, and recording the exit flux and far-field diffraction patterns. We achieved
  a compressed beam with a spot size of 16.48 nm (horizontal) Ã— 14.6 nm (vertical)
  near the waveguide exit plane, as determined from the reconstructed near-field distribution,
  at an exit flux which is eight times higher than that of an equivalent straight
  channel. Simulations indicate that this gain could reach three to four orders of
  magnitude for longer channels with tapering in two directions.
