abstract: We demonstrate a new design principle for unidirectionally invisible non-Hermitian
  structures that are not only invisible for one specific wavelength but rather for
  a broad frequency range. Our idea is based on the concept of constant-intensity
  waves, which can propagate even through highly disordered media without back-scattering
  or intensity variations. Contrary to already existing invisibility studies, our
  new design principle requires neither a specific symmetry (like $mathcalPT$-symmetry)
  nor periodicity, and can thus be applied in a much wider context. This generality
  combined with broadband frequency stability allows a pulse to propagate through
  a disordered medium as if the medium was entirely uniform.
