abstract: Based on nanofocusing refractive x-ray lenses a hard x-ray scanning microscope
  is currently being developed and is being implemented at beamline ID13 of the European
  Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France). It can be operated in transmission,
  fluorescence, and diffraction mode. Tomographic scanning allows one to determine
  the inner structure of a specimen. In this device, a monochromatic (E=21 keV) hard
  x-ray nanobeam with a lateral extension of 47×55 nm2 was generated. Further reduction
  of the beam size to below 20 nm is targeted. © 2005 American Institute of Physics.
