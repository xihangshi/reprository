abstract: The wave--particle duality of electrons was demonstrated in a kind of two-slit
  interference experiment using an electron microscope equipped with an electron biprism
  and a position-sensitive electron-counting system. Such an experiment has been regarded
  as a pure thought experiment that can never be realized. This article reports an
  experiment that successfully recorded the actual buildup process of the interference
  pattern with a series of incoming single electrons in the form of a movie.
