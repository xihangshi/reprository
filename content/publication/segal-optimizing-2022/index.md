abstract: "Far-UVC light can enable virus-deactivation while remaining harmless to
  human tissues. This triggered great efforts to create far-UVC light sources with
  sufficient emission power and efficiency. However, current sources, such as mercury
  lamps, KrCl excimer lamps, and LEDs, are made from hazardous chemicals or are limited
  by low efficiency. Consequently, an alternative approach for reaching the far-UVC
  is now receiving renewed interest: using phosphors for converting higher frequencies
  to the desired range of far-UVC. However, this concept is limited by the phosphor's
  conversion efficiency. In this paper, we propose to utilize principles of nanophotonics
  to create far-UVC sources. Specifically, we design a phosphor-dielectric multilayer
  that increases the efficiency of far-UVC light conversion and controls the intrinsic
  emission properties, including the angular spectrum and emission rate, by shaping
  the local density of photonic states. To exemplify our approach, we design an aperiodic
  multilayer nanostructure made of the phosphor material YPO4:Pr3+, showing an increase
  in light extraction by a factor of 3 compared to na√Øve bulk structures. Our approach
  can be applied to any phosphor material and any emitter geometry, opening avenues
  for engineering nanophotonic light sources in the far-UVC and other spectral regimes."
