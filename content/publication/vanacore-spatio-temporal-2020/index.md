abstract: The past decade has witnessed a quantum revolution in the ﬁeld of computation,
  communication and materials investigation. A similar revolution is also occurring
  for free-electron based techniques, where the classical treatment of a free electron
  as a point particle is being surpassed toward a deeper exploitation of its quantum
  nature. Adopting familiar concepts from quantum optics, several groups have demonstrated
  temporal and spatial shaping of a free-electron wave function, developing theoretical
  descriptions of light-modulated states, as well as predicting and conﬁrming fascinating
  phenomena as attosecond self-compression and orbital angular momentum transfer from
  light to electrons. In this review, we revisit the milestones of this development
  and the several methods adopted for imprinting a time-varying phase modulation on
  an electron wave function using properly synthesized ultrafast light ﬁelds, making
  the electron an exquisitely selective probe of out-of-equilibrium phenomena in individual
  atomic/nanoscale systems. We discuss both longitudinal and transverse phase manipulation
  of free-electrons, where coherent quantized exchanges of energy, linear momentum
  and orbital angular momentum mediating the electron–light coupling are key in determining
  their spatio-temporal redistribution. Spatio-temporal phase shaping of matter waves
  provides new routes toward image-resolution enhancement, selective probing, dynamic
  control of materials, new quantum information methods, and exploration of electronic
  motions and nuclear phenomena. Emerging as a new ﬁeld, electron wave function shaping
  allows adopting familiar quantum optics concepts in compositeparticle experiments
  and paves the way for atomic, ionic and nuclear wave function engineering with perspective
  applications in atomic interferometry and direct control of nuclear processes.
