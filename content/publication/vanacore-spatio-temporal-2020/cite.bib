 abstract = {The past decade has witnessed a quantum revolution in the ﬁeld of computation, communication and materials investigation. A similar revolution is also occurring for free-electron based techniques, where the classical treatment of a free electron as a point particle is being surpassed toward a deeper exploitation of its quantum nature. Adopting familiar concepts from quantum optics, several groups have demonstrated temporal and spatial shaping of a free-electron wave function, developing theoretical descriptions of light-modulated states, as well as predicting and conﬁrming fascinating phenomena as attosecond self-compression and orbital angular momentum transfer from light to electrons. In this review, we revisit the milestones of this development and the several methods adopted for imprinting a time-varying phase modulation on an electron wave function using properly synthesized ultrafast light ﬁelds, making the electron an exquisitely selective probe of out-of-equilibrium phenomena in individual atomic/nanoscale systems. We discuss both longitudinal and transverse phase manipulation of free-electrons, where coherent quantized exchanges of energy, linear momentum and orbital angular momentum mediating the electron–light coupling are key in determining their spatio-temporal redistribution. Spatio-temporal phase shaping of matter waves provides new routes toward image-resolution enhancement, selective probing, dynamic control of materials, new quantum information methods, and exploration of electronic motions and nuclear phenomena. Emerging as a new ﬁeld, electron wave function shaping allows adopting familiar quantum optics concepts in compositeparticle experiments and paves the way for atomic, ionic and nuclear wave function engineering with perspective applications in atomic interferometry and direct control of nuclear processes.},
