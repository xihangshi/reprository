abstract: As integrated circuits shrink in size, so does their nanocrystalline metal
  wiring. Defects at the interfaces between crystallites (grain boundaries) can degrade
  wires' electrical and thermal conductivity, as well as their longevity. Using scanning
  tunneling microscopy, Zhang et al. showed that the surfaces of nanocrystalline copper
  films are not flat but rather have ridges and valleys created by the grains rotating
  out of plane, which then introduces grain boundary defects. Such defects might be
  avoided if films of different orientations could be grown. Science, this issue p.
  397 Scanning tunneling microscopy reveals ridges and valleys in films created by
  defects at grain boundaries. We used scanning tunneling microscopy to study low-angle
  grain boundaries at the surface of nearly planar copper nanocrystalline (111) films.
  The presence of grain boundaries and their emergence at the film surface create
  valleys composed of dissociated edge dislocations and ridges where partial dislocations
  have recombined. Geometric analysis and simulations indicated that valleys and ridges
  were created by an out-of-plane grain rotation driven by reduction of grain boundary
  energy. These results suggest that in general, it is impossible to form flat two-dimensional
  nanocrystalline films of copper and other metals exhibiting small stacking fault
  energies and/or large elastic anisotropy, which induce a large anisotropy in the
  dislocation-line energy.
